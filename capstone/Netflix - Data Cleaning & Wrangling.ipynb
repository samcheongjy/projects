    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a recommender system to help users find movies and shows that fit their preferences and tastes so that they will be more likely to maintain a subscription with Netflix. Due to user privacy issues and the unavailability of datasets containing both movie content details and user ratings, we would be using _two_ separate datasets to build _two_ distinct recommender systems - **Content-Based Filtering Model** and **Collaborative Filtering Model**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a core focus for Netflix in recent years. Based on an academic paper penned by Gomez-Uribe and Netflix's Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt, they assert that ['the combined effect of personalization and recommendations is estimated to save them more than \\\\$1 billion per year.'](https://www.businessinsider.sg/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6?r=US&IR=T) This would be a significant area of cost savings for the tech giant as it is expected to spend more than [\\\\$17 billion on global content](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-2020-content-spending-17-billion-1203469237/) for the current financial year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 90 Seconds of Truth\n",
    "Based on findings from Netflix - “Consumer research suggests that a typical Netflix member loses interest after perhaps 60 to 90 seconds of choosing, having reviewed 10 to 20 titles (perhaps 3 in detail) on one or two screens. The user either finds something of interest or the risk of the user abandoning our service increases substantially.” Furthermore, Netflix estimates that only 20% of its subscriber video choices come from search, with the other 80% coming from recommendations. So it’s crucial that Netflix gets its recommendation system right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of the engine is “moments of truth,” when “a member starts a session and we help that member find something engaging within a few seconds, preventing abandonment of our service for an alternative entertainment option.”"
