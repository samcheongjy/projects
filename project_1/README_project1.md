### Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze the reasoning behind California's low participation rate in the ACT test for 2017 and 2018 and recommend practical solutions for how the College Board is able to increase participation rate amongst graduating seniors in California.  Comparisons will also be made against national averages and states such as Alabama and Kentucky where the ACT exam is mandatory and fully-funded for all graduating seniors.

### Data Set Used

- 2017 & 2018 ACT Scores
- 2017 & 2018 SAT Scores

### Methods Used

- Inferential Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)
