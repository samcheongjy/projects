### Executive Summary

Sortify is a new startup in the Singapore techology sector. Its business goals are both lofty and ambitious. It seeks to use the latest modelling tools to sort and classify all things that may seem too complex and technically challenging to where it belongs.

One of the projects that it is currently embarking on is a binary classification problem. The goal is to create a model to accurately classify reddit posts based on the subreddits that it originated from - r/pcmasterrace or r/mac. They will be creating two models to compare - Bayes Naive Classifier and Logistic Regression Model. 

The aim is to create a model  that is able to generalize well across new observations and accurately predict the origin of the posts from the correct subreddit.

Here at Sortify, we practice the principles of Marie Kondo all across our business lines. The models that we aim to build all ask the same question - does it spark joy? If it does, our codes allow us to keep what we want and discard anything that does not align to our principles. At the end of the day, you as the client will be able to enjoy the benefits of our state-of-the-art models that will put things in place to where they actually belong!
