#UPDATE

**I'm delighted to announce that I was recently appointed to the Communications Advisory Board of the Folding@home initiative: https://foldingathome.org/communication-advisory-board/**

**It's an honor for me to be included in a group with such distinctive individuals, and an awesome opportunity to help this wonderful project grow.**

Please check out the intro video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wypC32o1tPA

My mother passed away from cancer in July 2016, only 30 days after I was told that she had the condition.

Like me, many others have seen family and friends suffer with this plague. It all makes us feel helpless and desperate.

Only with scientific advancement is it possible to fight against cancer. There are little things that everyone can do to help such advancements happen sooner than they otherwise would. Our suggestion is the

# FOLDING@HOME PROJECT


**What is it?**

Folding@Home is a project by the Stanford University that uses our computing power to help study the process of protein folding so as to aid research on various diseases, including many forms of **cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's**.  It is basically a big distributed supercomputer, and you can contribute a node!


## What do I have to do to help out?

All you have to do is install a small program on your computer. Said programs downloads a small amount of data that it analyses.  When finished it then returns the results to the research teams and collects another task to work on. You can even [choose what disease research to base the bulk of your computing power on](http://i.imgur.com/uID425t.jpg) or just let it fold them for all projects! 

## I don't have a 9900k and RTX 2080Ti. Is my effort worth anything?

Everyone, no matter the hardware they possess, has a chance to help researchers fight against cancer and other illnesses, and, perhaps, make a big difference in the life of other people, or even their own. While the better your CPU, and especially GPU, the more folding power, every little bit can help!

[Overclock.net has a good resource where you can check where different GPUs rank on what concerns folding](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vcVoSVtamcoGj5sFfvKF_XlvuviWWveJIg_iZ8U2bf0/pub?output=html)

## Joining is easy and takes about 3 minutes!

1. Visit [this link](http://folding.stanford.edu/start-folding/) and download the installer.

2. Install the software. [(Windows guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/windows/) | [(Linux guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/linux/) | [(Mac guide)](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/installation-guides/mac/)


**That's it!**

You can choose any username you want, even if it's already taken, and select to be part of a team to 'compete' against other teams to see who can accomplish ""the most science"".  [Our team number is 225605](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png) but you do not have to join ours. Regardless of which team you join (or even if you don't join any) you are still helping!

In the [initial config screen](http://i.imgur.com/fbIiZCn.png), you can also have a [passkey](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/passkey/) e-mailed to you. You can add this string in the app settings, and that will give you extra folding points, under some criteria, if you finish your work units before scheduled!  For higher end hardware, finishing early happens very often!  [Folding@Home benchmarks their tasks on an older first gen i5.](http://folding.stanford.edu/support/faq/points/#how-is-the-qrb-determined).  If your machine is more powerful, you will do better!

## But doesn't this make my computer run very hot?

If you want it to, yes. It is designed to run your system as hard as it can to get the fastest returns on results.

However, you have control as to when it runs and how quickly you want it to run.  Your options are Light, Medium or Full.

* **Light:** CPU is Folding at half speed and the GPU is not Folding at all.
* **Medium:** CPU is Folding at three-quarter speed.  GPU Folding is enabled and at full speed.  Medium is selected by default.
* **High:** CPU is Folding at full blast and so is the GPU.  This will consume the most power and generate the most heat.

You can also control whether or not you want to Fold while you're doing other things.

* While I'm working: Folding is enabled (as above) at all times.
* Only when idle: Starts folding when you leave the machine for a couple minutes.

Many people also find that running it at medium or even high makes no difference on what concerns performance if you're only just browsing the internet. It all depends on your specs.

If those options aren't enough and you want some more control, you have many more advanced options.

* Programs like [TThrottle](http://efmer.com/b/) can suspend and resume Folding based on the CPU / GPU temperature.  F@H already does this, but only at extreme temperatures.
* F@H can be configured so it only uses the number of CPU cores you want it to.
* Programs like MSI Afterburner can make sure your GPU will never go past a certain temperature when folding.

If, instead, you are going for MAX/FULL power folding, then know that Folding@home is designed to max your parts even more than video games or benchmarks!  This means your temperatures will be higher than normal so you will want to check what they reach and/or tweak your CPU/GPU fan curves so they run at a higher speed. Your CPU and GPU *are* designed for this.

Consider running a monitoring program alongside when folding at a constant FULL level. Some program recommendations are [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/index.php/software/20-occt), [MSI's Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) or other similar programs. 

# TEAM PCMR

[Team ""PC Master Race - PCMR""](http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&amp;teamnum=225605) (225605) has the potential to be one of the top 15 teams in the world.  Right now we are ranked [**20th** in the world](http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_list.php?s=&amp;t=225605#225605) and there is plenty of room for you!

Even if you don't want to join any team, or have another team in mind to join, the important thing is that you join folding@home!

If you have any questions, ask them here! You can also refer to the previous versions of this thread, linked at the beginning of this thread.

I am about to build a new PC for my workplace and was wondering if there is a way to use my old ""data"" on the new PC. Like when you get a new phone you can make a backup of your old phone and keep all your settings, images and so on so it's like you only switched hardware but not software. Does that make any sense? I don't know how else to write it (english is not my main language). I don't want to install all the drivers and required programs I need for work again as this would just be too much effort. I also didn't use a OEM key for windows so that should not be an issue.

So I've used my 2nd [monitor](https://imgur.com/pOkd6Jq) with my old laptop for a long time using the VGA cord. My new(er) laptop doesn't have this port as they stopped a while ago. I found this [VGA/HDMI adapter](https://imgur.com/Vq36T4M) and decided to try and set it up. 

The monitor isn't identified despite it being recognized in the [advanced settings](https://imgur.com/CyEMR9n). The display settings also switches from [this](https://imgur.com/dFt21eA) to [this](https://imgur.com/nHMR5lK) when I plug it in. So it is kinda being recognized, but not identified. The screen of the second monitor does not respond at all when I plug it in (but it does still work with my old laptop). 

I've tried disabling and reinstalling drivers and going through several troubleshoots online to figure this out, resulting only in frustration.

I have already purchased the case (DLM22 mATX) and a motherboard (MSI B360m Bazooka, LGA 1151). I purchased the motherboard because I was deadset on having an Intel build, but after seeing the new RX 5600xt get released today, I'm questioning if that was a good choice due to the ram limitations/inability to overclock with the 9400f.

204,Why is my PC's wifi so slow?,"So I've spent the better part of the past 2 hours trying to figure out why the wifi on my PC is so much slower than my other devices. This isnt a new problem, but this is the first time I've actually tried to figure out why and I'm at a loss.

I have run a bunch of speedtests on both my 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks to get averages for my different devices and have found my pc is significantly slower than all of my other devices. All tests were performed while sitting at the desk my pc is at. I used by phone (Galaxy s9+) and my Microsoft Surface Book to compare to my PC. For my pc I tested with both my old [Rosewill N900](https://www.newegg.com/rosewill-rnwd-n9003pce-pci-express/p/N82E16833166076) adapter I've had since 2014, and my new [TP-Link AC1300](https://amazon.com/dp/B016K0896K) adapter. here are the results as a 20 run average:

206,About to pull the trigger on a used Graphics Card. Need advice.,"So, i've been browsing FB marketplace for about 2 weeks.

This guy has had an ad for an Rx 580 4 Gig posted for over a week now, and has dropped the price to $90. I messaged him and said i was interested. He claims to build PC's and sell them as a side job. He came across this card about 7 months ago from a customer of his who traded in his current PC for a higher end one, and said the customer had the card for about 6 months (gaming).

The guy is more than willing and actually insistent that I test the card out in my PC and run whatever test, benchmark, GPUz i want to run to ensure that it works and is in good condition. The several different pictures that he has posted on the ad show the card in very good condition. He lives about 40 miles from me, and was okay with either me coming to his place to set up my pc and test, or him driving out to me for additional price (for gas and time) to test the card at my house.

two things kind of made me weary, one is that his FB profile seems very bland, his profile picture is a picture of tigger from winnie the pooh, and no other pictures, not sure if he has his account to private. Been a facebook account since like 2010 though.

Also, I messaged him today, and he pretty much immediately offered to drive to my side of town tonight to let me test it, because i told him I wouldn't be able to meet until tomorrow unless he came to me tonight.

Also, he's preferring cash instead of paypal (understandable, since people just chargeback all the time).

**Basically what i'm asking, is if i'm able to run a benchmark, check the GPUz report, and do a stress test, is this a very safe buy from my perspective?**

230,From GTX680 to GTX1080Ti,"In October 2019, I was trying to sell my old i7 930 online and a person (lets call him DA) got in touch with me. He wanted to upgrade his i7 920. I instead told him to get a Xeon X5675. But this isn't the story I want to tell.


**Story Time**


It was September 2019 and DA wanted to upgrade his ancient GTX680. He managed to buy a second hand (mining) RX580 for USD130 and sold his GTX680 for USD62. He was satisfied with the performance. Then he met me.


October 2019 and I managed to get DA a great deal on a one month old GTX1660Ti for USD136. He managed to sell his RX580 for USD114. He loved the upgrade and got hooked (like me) to checking the online second hand marketplace multiple times a day.


November 2019 and he managed to bargain his way to a GTX1080 for USD217. The card had overheating issues but I replaced the thermal paste and it ran like new. He sold his GTX1660ti for USD217.


January 2019 and I managed to show him a deal on a GTX1080ti. He managed to get it for USD395. Plan is now to sell the GTX1080 for USD300.


So in 5 months... DA went from a GTX680 to a GTX1080Ti for a mere USD185. I'm so proud.

250,"updating router, but need help deciding between two routers.","Hi everyone, I am trying to decide between netgear  Nighthawk AX8 and the Nighthawk PRO GAMING XR700.

This is a fairly new PC and it has just started around after 4 months after purchase of the computer. I am completely unsure on what the problem is, It was a prebuilt/parts chosen from ibuypower and I still have a warranty on it. I do have list of parts if that would help. I am kinda no clue on how to continue or fix this anymore unsure if its a ram stick that is damaged or something else.

270,I think it might be time to replace my PSU...,"I upgraded my workstation/gaming rig last year. I moved from a GTX 1080 and i7 3930k to an X299 build with an RTX 2080 Ti and i7 9800X. I put new RAM an M.2 SSD and upgraded the HDD storage to 4TB WD Black drives for media storage. I kept my case and 750W Corsair PSU from 2014 thinking everything would be just fine...

Ever since I installed the new components the PC has worked just fine (great, actually), but there have been some strange noises coming from the case. It started as what I thought might be GPU coil whine. When I would run benchmarks or graphics heavy games there would be a grinding sort of noise coming from the case (sometimes when editing or rendering video too, but not always). I didn't want to go through the RMA process just to maybe get another whiny GPU, so I just decided to live with it.

Recently the noise is present intermittently even when the PC is idling. I've tried my best to isolate the source of the noise, but it has been difficult to pinpoint where it's coming from. During idle it's a sound that resembles a click, but it's too low frequency for me to believe it's the HDD (I've had HDDs fail on me before and it's not the same sound) and the sound seems to be coming from the back of the case.

I've already ordered the replacement... I'll report back when it's installed on Friday...

295,How to tell which of CPU or motherboard is defective,"Recently have been attempting to build a new computer but have been running into the same issue. The fans start up for about 28 seconds and then stop and restart there is no beep.


After trying everything on checklists, down to just using CPU, PSU and motherboard on cardboard  I'm still not getting any motherboard beeps. I've already reset CMOS twice. This is tested with no Ram, and according to the manufacturer I should get three beeps if there is no Ram.

I've confirmed with the power supply works by substituting one from computer that was working so I know it's not the PSU.

So, how can I find out if it's motherboard or CPU that's defective? As one small note, if I leave out the eight pin connector the fans start and keep running without a reboot loop, would this indicate that the CPU is the issue?

But i still get absolute horrid speeds? Here are some photos of speed tests done on a few sites within minutes of each other. I can do these tests every few min and get 15-70mb/s download speed. 

also screen cap of me trying to DL Escape from Tarkov (17gb) at an embarrassing speed. 

This also happen when i tried to download other games as well. they never get above 10mb/s download it seems?

Anyway, I put this build together and was hoping it would just boot up off a windows install key with the GPU card hooked up? Is it that simple? I’ve only used discrete graphics on the CPU and I’m not sure if I need to take extra steps to get it to work (drivers?).

**TL:DR** Corsair Hydro X Custom loop experience was very good

I have received some messages on this and a few other platforms where I posted pictures of this cute little build talking about the Corsair Hydro X water Loop and the build process involved. I chose hard mode by not starting with a highly compatible case for the amount of gear I was stuffing in it, much like a chicken is great and stuffed with peppers and cheese is better, too much of a good thing can end up almost spilling out of the sides. But I digress, lets talk about the real experience of getting all of the parts to work together inside of the confines I chose to work with.

The Radiators are exceptionally high build quality, only going with a fully copper radiator could have provided a higher quality experience. The fittings are exceptional quality both in fitment and manufacturing process. I nicked one of the internal O rings on a single fitting during a botched dry fit. I will find out if they will ship me, or if I can purchase a replacement O ring from Corsair. Key take away always lube up the O rings before shoving a pipe in. The pump and reservoir combination is very quiet, and well-built with very clear high quality plastic. The only downside on the pump would be the Molex power connector not a SATA connector, but this is minor. Fans are obviously grade A as the LL series are top of the line pulse width modulated  control and hydraulic bearings making them functionally silent until fully ramped up.

&amp;#x200B;

The Corsair iCUE software is extremely useful at tying the environment together with keeping the temperature, fan speed, lighting, and control all in sync with each other. I cannot emphasize enough that there are cheaper solutions, but this is the best solution to have all of the features you are actually going to use work together. This build required not one but two commander pro’s for all of the fans, pump, temperature probes, etc to play nice together. That is expensive, but they all work together and the software functions the way you want it to function not some massive work around.

&amp;#x200B;

But lets get to the thing people really want to talk about, tube bending. This was my first attempt ever at bending the tubes, and I destroyed one length just figuring out how to do it. Once I understood to go slow, and work with it at the correct feeling temperature (it gets a little bendy with out touching it when hot) things went smooth. Key take away is that the inserts to hold the shape are mandatory, Corsair really needs to sell an insert kit, instead I ended up with a complicated home depot hack job insert of tubing to make this work. As for cutting the tubes I just used a 12” circular saw with ultra-fine tooth finishing blade because I didn’t want to screw around with a hacksaw.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I would recommend the experience of building a fully custom water loop at some point if you have the funds, the time, and the understanding that things could go real bad. Long story short it was a fun weekend project. Thank you Corsair for cultivating a product line that is exceptionally high quality with parts that I feel can be trusted.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,Tim

(3440x1440p Ultrawide with GSync, Intel i7 8700k, Z370)","I now have a spare GTX 1080 and am on the fence between selling or keeping it. I typically play AAA games, and do light video editing (just personal things, like turning GoPro video of family vacation into something neat)

If I sell the GTX, I will effectively offset the cost of my new RTX. Which would be the financially prudent course of action. But honestly I'm OK holding onto the GTX if I can justify a reason to do so. The only thing I can think of is if I were to SLI, but I'm not even sure if that would be possible with GTX and RTX. 

This is what I understand about SLI:

* Generally not supported in games (or worth it based on skimming posts online)
* works best with GPUs of same kind (1080ti 1080ti, 2080 2080, etc.)
* Gains are minimal/modest at best

Despite the negatives of SLI, I would still be interested in experiencing SLI myself if its possible with my GTX and RTX. I'd like to have a performance boost (however small), have a spare GPU in case one fails, and I also have a bunch of monitors so having the RTX connected to my ultrawide for gaming and the GTX connected to peripherals for browsers seems like its not the worst idea.

439,8pin to 6+2pin PCI-E for 2060 super,"so my gtx 970 is getting an rtx 2060 super replacement( waiting for collection at the post office), and while the 970 had 2 no. 6 pin connectors, the 2060 super has 1 no.  8 pin. The issue is my PSU came with a 8 to 6+2 pin connector, which I wouldn't think would be an issue, but the image on the back of the PSU shows the last 2 pins are just grounds. 

Is this correct? Is this because the PSU is old, or are these essentially 'dummies'? Should it be 4 live, 4 ground? 

They seem to have been a bit lazy with the cable terminations into the PCI connectors also, doubling up one of the grounds and leaving one blank (but its ground so hey ho.)

Cant seem to find anything online saying what the pins should actually be for a 8pin PCI E, and can see any other PSUs labeling these 

The cable itself has doubled up one of the grounds. Image below, courtesy of google

443,It won't let me adjust the CPU VCCIO/System Agent Voltage,"Hi,

I've been trying to stablize my system all day ans found that my PC doesn't like that particular voltage. When I let auto manage everything, the voltage would fluctuate between 1.25 and 1.4. It worked well at 1.35v and stayed there for a couple days but then during boot, it would change.

Now that I've disabled auto and put in manual values for most things (I'm using XMP I) watching a video, trying to eliminate the fluctuates, I've found that the problem still persists and I'm almost 100% sure it's because of voltage. But it won't let me edit it. If I disable XMP and set it to manual, I can change DRAM voltage but not VCCIO OR System Agent Voltage.

Can you help me?

Thanks

So as the title says, my computer currently won't post? I came home from work looking to unwind and play some games on my computer. Only to be greeted by a lovely ""no video detected"" on my monitor.

 PC specs below along with things I have already tried.



Things I've already tried:

Clear CMOS - no change
Unplugged/replugged GPU - no change
Swapped GPU to R9 Fury - no change
Unseated RAM &amp; tested each one at a time - no change 
Turned on PC with no RAM&amp;GPU - no change BUT, CPU fan at max speed and debug LEDs for CPU&amp;RAM were on


PC specs:

Ryzen 7 2700x - stock clocks never OC'd
Asus Vega 64 Strix
MSI X370 gaming pro carbon
Team T-Force RGB 16GB Ram @2933mhz
EVGA SuperNova 850w G3
LG Ultrawide 21:9
HP EX 920 512G (OS drive)
Intel 660p 1TB
SanDisk 128G
Toshiba X300 8TB
Western digital blue 1TB


At this point I am at a loss. Don't know what else to troubleshoot besides taking the CPU out. I have my old Ryzen 1700 I could try. However I don't think it's a CPU issue as my msi motherboard has debug LEDs and none of them are on.. at all? Even when I turn the computer on without a GPU, none of the LEDs turn on when they should, especially if no GPU is in the system. Does this sound like the motherboard is toast? 

Open to any and all feedback!

453,Just got a 1440p 165Hz monitor from a 1080p 144Hz monitor and the difference is astounding,"My old monitor broke because I had a blanket on it so I could cover light while AFKing overnight and trying to sleep (I easily could've covered just the PC rather than the whole thing but I didn't think of that) and it fell over while I was asleep.

Because of that I found a video on YouTube talking about good 144hz 1440p monitors, and I decided on this Dell one (my previous monitor was Viotek and also really good). I picked it up, unboxed it and set it up.

First thing I did was change it from 60Hz to 144Hz because I can't handle using anything under 90Hz for too long, then I found a feature to ""overclock"" it to 165Hz (didn't know monitors could be overclocked).

My main incentive for this post however was how goddamn amazing 1440p looks compared to 1080p. Like, it's way, way, way better and it was the first thing I noticed. Honestly, considering how aesthetically appealing 1440p is compared to 1080p I can't fathom what a jump to 4k would be like.

459,"Finally bought an IPS monitor. Kinda disappointed, am I missing something?/","Hello PCMR,

So one of the monitors I had for a long time because it became so dim it was hard to see anything (Acer V223W if curious) and I figured it was going to be as good a time as any to grab something new. 

I was on the look for whatever new hotness I could get since its been 7-8 years since I bought them. I heard everything saying IPS panels are glorious and how they have amazing viewing angles and saw a Shell Shocker deal for these 75hz Freesync IPS panels at a decent price https://www.newegg.ca/lg-22bk430h-b-21-5-full-hd/p/N82E16824025903

Thought I had hit gold, but when they finally arrived and i got everything set up, I'm fairly perplexed. I don't see why people are saying these panels have great viewing angles considering that I can't even uniformly see the screen when Im looking direclty at it. Discord should be a flat background, but when looked at from these monitors, there is a huge amount of gradient going on. If i barely move my head from one shoulder to the other, I can see a huge gloss happen throughout the display and it is highly disorienting. Looking at the chat frame feel like it has a silver/grey gradient to it unless I am directly adjusting myself to look at that corner of the screen. That feel like a viewing angle issue but i'm just trying to use my monitor regularly, not looking at it through some weird angles.

Is there something I'm missing? Is this the ""silvering"" that many people talks about as ""being normal for IPS"" and to just get used to it? I'm someone with mild colorblindness (Protonopia: Red light have lower intensity than normal, have difficulty differenciating Blue/Purples and Green/Yellows) and im scared that these constant changes and ""gloss"" hapepening across the screen will cause great doubt/anxiety.

Is this normal? Should I refund them and get myself newer TN panels? Because I liked my old monitors and these are new ones are only an improvement if I'm looking at them from a very specific angle, kinda like the 3D effect of the 3DS.

462,Hello everyone GPU suggestions requested,"So I currently have a Red Dragon Vega 56 and truth be told it’s been a great card (AMD software issues aside). But I’m also about to start a custom loop and the Bykski block I have for the nano PCB will fit with a few mods. This is the only block that I have found available or the nano block and honestly even fewer people have used it on this specific card because Powercolors red dragon nano pcb has to be just a little different than the others (go figure).

My question is do I go ahead and attempt to attach the block with the hassle and struggle of trying to get the mods just right so it functions and possible risk of damaging cars.

Or do I look for another card, cards coming out now are surpassing the Vega line with what seems to be little effort. I know a water cooled Vega with a 64 wet bios flash+ a power table will basically put it at 1080ti level but is it worth the effort?

I see the liquid devil 5700xt, or a reference 5700xt and adding a water block and even with the lower prices of the 2060 coming out maybe even 2070s as viable options. I just don’t really know what to do, I enjoy trying to overclock (Vega doesn’t do well on air), undervolt and so on.

491,How to solve CPU throttling in laptop?,"I have problems with my laptop. The Dell laptop that I have has some serious fps rubber banding. When CPU stepping is on it changes frequency (down/up clocks) all the time during gaming and every 30seconds I get heavy framrate dips. I have disabled CPU stepping in BIOS but when I do that the CPU stays at a low base clock of 1.8GHz (Turbo boost takes it up to 4GHz but only works with CPU stepping enabled) whicj is results in really poor performance in games. So as I see it the solution here is to increase the base clock frequency to around 2.6GHz and then keep it stable at that. Anyone here know how to do that? The BIOS is very limited but perhaps it could be done through changing some registers?

I want to upgrade it next month and will have about 200 to spend on it. I can either go for a 3600 for a huge CPU step up or a used 1070/1070ti or even Vega card for 200. 

I'm thinking a new GPU will help more right now as the 1500X is a 4c/8t chip and upgrades for it will only continue to get cheaper later. And it's stock so I can always OC it to try and make up for some performance in the meantime if I buy a better cooler for it.

511,Mining RX 570 BIOS reflash,"A couple of weeks ago, I bought a used Sapphire Nitro+ RX 570 8GB off ebay (I know, I know, probably an old miner card but the seller has 100% with thousands of reviews).  Since it came, and it worked (stress tested it with furmark for a few hours, it never went over 65C), I've mostly just been enjoying the upgrade, which was a big step up from my old R7 260x 2gb.

However, the last couple days, I've been poking around under the hood, looking at the clocks and temperatures in game (was only watching FPS in game), playing with small overclocks (no voltage adjustments) and checking out if the other bios performed differently.

Everything seemed normal until I noticed that the card never came close to reaching it's stock core speed with either bios even when overclocking, which is supposed to be 1340mhz/1750mhz core/vram. I got ATIFlash (latest version from tech power up) to see what bios is on there, and there are two different ones.

I've found them both on techpowerup, and they're labeled as unverified. I assume the bios is underclocked for mining purposes, and that's also maybe why my max temperature was ever only ~65C. So I've downloaded both the available *verified* bios from techpowerup, and just wanted a second opinion before I start flashing.

I know I'd have to mess up pretty bad to brick my card, but just want to make sure my information is correct and procedure sound before I proceed, only thing I've ever done with a bios is update a motherboard.


Step 1: Boot with bios 2

Step 2: Flash bios 1

Step 3: Boot into bios 1

Step 4: Flash bios 2


This might be altered slightly if I'm on bios 2 and I flash bios 1, and it flashes over Bios 2. Then I'd just boot bios 1 and flash bios 2.

541,"Upgraded internet for that sweet ping and download speed, now dealing with issues I don't understand. Save me pls.","Hey everyone.

Recently I upgraded my internet to some sexy high speed fibre. My router arrived and I plugged it in as instructed on the day requested. This Vodafone router apparently spits internet out at 2.4ghz and 5ghz. 

Much excite.

So I order a new WiFi usb thingy, and thanks to a certain prime delivery service, I had it the next day. I plug it in, I boot up my games of choice, and I think to myself.

This is it folks. I can stream in peace. I can game safely without dry humping a random bench.

Well. I was wrong. I'm not sure what the issues are. But I'm rubberbanding everywhere no matter the game, with ping spiking every fifteen to twenty seconds from 12 to over 1000.

Now at first I thought maybe it's the internet. Vodafone claim I need to give it ten days to wait for the connection to, and I quote, ""stabilise."" However. If I plug my old 2.4ghz dongle back in and boot up my pc, whilst I lose 25-30mbps download speed, I don't rubberband at all. 

My pc is in the adjacent room to the router. About six meters from it total, with a single wall between the two. 

The other thing was, last night I pulled the 2.4 back out, stuck the 5ghz one back in, and managed to smash out a few hours of gaming with absolutely no issues. 

Ha HA, I thought. The issue if gone!

False. I tried again this morning, and I'm back to phasing into objects and people like a bloody demon on cocaine. 

So. What gives? Am I missing something here? Is it really because I need to wait ten days? If so, why does the 2.4 have no issues, big the 5ghz does? Why did it work last night, but is back to hating me this morning?

542,No RGB fan options,"Hello,
I just want to vent my frustration about the state of the fan market right now.

I don't know much about RGB, or fans, or markets for that matter, but after hours and hours of googling, i found nothing.

There are literally thousands of options of all kinds of fans, big, small, black, white, metal, for static pressure, for airflow, high and low tech bearings, frameless fans that connect to wifi, etc. Cool.

But... the thing that sucks is always the pretty side, and the thing that blows is always the ugly side.

I need the pretty side to blow and the ugly side to suck.

Why in the world would I ever want to spend hundred bucks for a set of awesome looking, all white RGB fans with silver aluminium rims and then flip them around just to stare at some generic ugly black plastic bracket they all have, with some part numbers, bar codes and coloured wires sticking out?

Hello Lian Li? Hello Corsair? Hello literally everybody else?

There are forums where people are asking about how to reverse the direction of a fan for this reason, but all the manufacturers have to do is colour match the damn back bracket and put the sticker somewhere else.

Additionally an LED on the motherboard keeps blinking red.


By this point I've now removed the ram and graphics card, as well as attempted a CMOS reset. Thus far nothing has changed.

The only exception to this is when I don't have the CPU plugged in. Essentially just the motherboard and case fans. These will start and remain started without any reboots.

556,Best bang/buck 1TB NVME SSD optimizing for 4K random write IOPS and TBW?,"Hi all,

&amp;nbsp;

As the title states, I'm looking for an NVME SSD with relatively long endurance and high write performance for small files. I'm running simulations in parallel which append data to a file at about 1kB to 10kB per write. The write speed is currently the bottleneck. Given that they run in parallel I suppose I need random write performance.

&amp;nbsp;

The costs of the more pro oriented SSDs (Intel optane/Samsung pro) are a bit prohibitive for me, as I'm a student and need it for my thesis; I'm aiming at the 130-180 dollar price bracket. I already have a Kingston A2000 for my OS and many other things, but I cannot spare the space for the simulations I'm performing.

&amp;nbsp;

I was thinking of:

Name | NAND | TBW | Controller | Claimed 4k wr. IOPS | Local price
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Kingston A2000 | TLC | 600TB | SM2263 | 220k IOPS | 140eu
Kingston KC2000 | TLC | 600TB | SM2262 | 275k IOPS | 170eu
Adata XPG Gammix S11 Pro | TLC | 640TB | SM2262EN | 380k IOPS | 160eu
WD Black SN750 (no heatsink)| TLC | 600TB | WD 'in-house' | 560k IOPS | 160eu
Samsung PM981 | TLC | 600TB | Phoenix | 440k IOPS | 163eu
Samsung 970 EVO | TLC | 600TB | Phoenix | 450k IOPS | 165eu
Adata XPG SX6000 Pro | TLC | 600TB | RTS5763DL | 240k IOPS | 135eu
Corsair MP510| TLC | 1700TB | PS5012-E12 | 570k IOPS | 163eu
Adata XPG SX8200 Pro | TLC | 640TB | SM2262EN | 380k IOPS | 151eu
PNY XLR8 CS3030 | TLC | 1665TB | PS5012-E12 | 200k IOPS | 130eu

Looking at these numbers I should go for the Corsair MP510. But how come that it would outperform more expensive and recent models? Perhaps the claimed IOPS are completely off? They don't report sustained performance perhaps?

&amp;nbsp;

Looking at [these](https://www.kitguru.net/components/ssd-drives/simon-crisp/pny-xlr8-cs3030-1tb-ssd-review/10/) graphs I should go for a Samsung 970 Evo or a WD Black SN750, at the cost of lower TBW.

However, the MP510 performance is at about 80% of the 970 Evo/WD SN750, but has almost triple the TBW. 

&amp;nbsp;

Note that I don't expect to fill the drive more than 200 times for the simulations, so 600TBW should be sufficient, even though I would 'only' have 400TBW of guaranteed continued use for it afterwards.

&amp;nbsp;

567,Epic games hijacks Steam shortcuts?," So i bought The Talos principle a while back on steam, and then later it was free on epic store, so i just took it. I installed it on epic store just because i wanted to enable cheats and go with noclip around the maps just for fun (it disables achievements so i didn't want to do it on steam). And now when i run the game from desktop shortcut, the steam shortcut somehow changes into epic shortcut and open epic store. I tried deleting and adding shortcuts several times and it happens every time.

I'm about to pull the trigger on a new build running 155fps on a 155hz 1440p IPS Monitor. Ryzen 3900X, 2080TI.

This is the monitor I'm looking at (not in the wishlist above): [https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B07WQ4FXY9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B07WQ4FXY9) 

Does it look good, or would anyone change anything? I feel like the ram is priced high, but this ram is timed significantly better than other 3200 ddr4 that was half the price so not sure if I should go with this ram, or drop down to around $160 for the same amount of RAM from g.skill with higher timings.

Also, one of the better 2080TI's I could find price wise with good reviews, and traditionally I was always a fan of EVGA cards.

Decided to do a 500gb and a 1TB M.2. drive, 500 for the os, and 1TB for game drive.

I also use this machine for work, and am getting into game dev on MonoGame so wanted to just go all out on the GPU. I thought about a 2080 Super but the 2080ti is better even if the price gap isn't justified for the performance gain.",1,6,xabrol,0,build feedback am4 3900x,link build https secure newegg com wishlist sharedwishlistdetail id r3q6pvt7t30gtyjmww 2fpig 3d 3d https secure newegg com wishlist sharedwishlistdetail id r3q6pvt7t30gtyjmww 2fpig 3d 3d pull trigger new build running 155fps 155hz 1440p ips monitor ryzen 3900x 2080ti monitor looking wishlist https www amazon com dp product b07wq4fxy9 https www amazon com dp product b07wq4fxy9 look good would anyone change anything feel like ram priced high ram timed significantly better 3200 ddr4 half price sure go ram drop around 160 amount ram g skill higher timings also one better 2080ti could find price wise good reviews traditionally always fan evga cards decided 500gb 1tb 2 drive 500 os 1tb game drive also use machine work getting game dev monogame wanted go gpu thought 2080 super 2080ti better even price gap justified performance gain,build feedback am4 3900x ,build feedback am4 3900x ,build feedback am4 3900x ,build feedback am4 3900x ,build feedback am4 3900x ,build feedback am4 3900x 
572,Sticky situation with RMA and my 2080's fans/cooler,"Hey everyone, so some 2/ maybe 2 and a half weeks ago i decided to send my KFA2 2080 back for RMA since the left fan's bearing started acting up, making noise and all that kinda crap.  


Now heres the longer version of the story: (I'll have a TL;DR below)  


After sending it and having waited 2 weeks i finally get told that they cannot do anything about my GPU since the left fan's sticker is missing ([heres a pic of it in the box after i took it out and prepared it for the courier to pick it up](https://imgur.com/a/V7LPoqa)). Now the story behind that sticker missing is actually kinda fun: after buying my GPU some 1 year ago the left sticker just fell down (most likely a combination of lazy placement of the glue or whatever it is that was keeping it there and heat) and i couldn't put it back on. I decided ""welp, i have no use for this thing anymore so i might as well get rid of it"" and i just threw it knowing that there are no serial numbers on it or anything that would void the warranty.  


Fast forward 1 year and now im this situation i mentioned above: im on my old Strix 970, with the 2080 not repaired cause they want a sticker on the damn broken fan (i also forgot to mention that the morning before taking the GPU out the bearing would stop working at all and it would try to spin a few times before succeeding). I don't have the sticker anymore so sending it back with it is basically out of the options, but i still have some things i can try (surprisingly):  


1. First is trying to call the actual company that sold the GPU and not just the RMA department to see if they can actually do something about this shitty situation
2. 2nd would be calling the Customer Support Services and having them try to sort out the situation
3. 3rd and probably the one that might be the only plausible outcome is buying one of the Arctic coolers that will make my GPU 3x heavier and bigger but it would at least have some working fans and better cooling

&amp;#x200B;

Now, ik that most of you may be wondering ""wtf is the point of this post?"" - well this is half a post about venting and half a post about asking for help: ***what is the best course of action i can take to get out of this?***  


***Here's the TL;DR: Company doesn't want to repair/send back my money for the 2080 - for a missing sticker that fell on its own and wouldn't stick back, now I'm stuck wondering what i should do.***  


Also for anyone curios about the country I'm in: I'm from Romania and have bought the 2080 from a shop that sells locally.

579,A few questions regarding the Asus Zephyrus S GX701," So I've now owned the Zephyrus S GX701 (RTX 2060 version) for about 6 months now.

Besides a few problems (which I'm gonna address later), the expierence has been great.

Now to the questions.

I saw a youtube video ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-RANuMwU0c&amp;t=290s)) about the Zephyrus where he talks about ""Undervolting the cpu by -0.07"" which leasd to lower temperaturs AND HIGHER clock speed. How do you undervolt? How does it work? Why does it increase his clock speed? Also, what are some other manual tweaks you guys use on this laptop? Which programs do you use for it?

Low-end games seems to make the fans go as crazy as they do with high-end games, is this supposed to happen?

I can't find a option to turn on the lightning for the logo (inside) and the rgb lightning near the air exhausts. Also the lightning on the volume scroller doesn't light up either. I know the lightnings works, as it is turned on while the laptop is turning on, but then the RGB lightning turns off after starting windows. How do I turn them on again?

The volume scroller only works after I click on it, which means i have to mute my audio before I can adjust it. Can i disable this, so I don't have to click on it to adjust volume?

Why did my laptop not come with the camera? Is it because I live in Denmark? Do you think i can get it for free, if i contact asus, and pay for shipment?

I can't use ""My Asus"" to update with. The whole app is bugged. Will this lead to negative consequence?

Have anyone tried using Ocolus Quest Link on a Zephyrus S GX701? If so, does it work?

Oh, and using jackstick are really anoying. Whenever i plug it in, windows asks what kind of speaker i plugged in, and the audio won't work until i choose something. Problem is, that sometimes that message won't pop up, and i have to unplug and plug in the jack stick multiple times, before the message pops up. While playing video games, the message never pops up. Is it possible to make it always use plugged in jackstick?

Would a laptop cooling pad have any effect at all? This laptop doesn't have any exhausts on the underside.

CLEANING:

A few crums and other stuff have found a way to get stuck in the small inhailing holes. What are some technics to suck them out? (same with things stuck between the keysboard keys).

Do I have to fully open it for dust removal, or is opening the back panel, and using a compressed air can on the exposed fans enough?

Other general cleaning and caretaking advice?

594,How high should idle VRM temps be?,"Hello good people of pcmr

I've been having worries about my VRM temps, so I did a bit of googling and people are saying they can hit over 100 under load without a problem, but my question is would high idle temps affect them long-term? My PC is on the whole day most of the time and sometimes also overnight, and the VRMs idle at around 75C (while everything else is like 35C). I can't really bring those temps down any other way than to clock my CPU down which is not ideal.

638,I can't figure out the cause of this lag I am getting,"Ok, so here is the deal, I downgraded to a Ryzen 3600 from an i9 9900k, reinstalled windows after a clean format, and everything was fine.

Using an MXI X570 Gaming Edge Wifi board, 32GB Corsair 3200.

At first, the 3600 was fine, no issues. About 5 days ago, I started getting weird lag, I play World of Tanks a lot. The lag was noticeable only in the game, when someone destroyed something, and the physics kicked off, like a CPU issue. It's not small lag either, it literally gets me killed, because sometimes the delay can be a few MS, to a few seconds.

So I tried using DDU and reinstalling the nvidia driver, I also updated my AMD driver to make sure it had the power plan and the latest drivers.

This fixed it, for about 10 minutes, then it started again, so it likely just fixed itself on reboot.

I tried a clean reboot, no services, no startup, no change.

If my background changes, I get about a 1 second delay, the CPU spikes to 20% anytime the background changes.

I tested with turning on the boost lock on X1 to see if it was the GPU boosting, no change.

I had a slight overclock on the 3600, to 4 ghz, only about 1.275v. Got rid of that, no change.

I completely reset the bios, made sure it was on the latest version, You can guess, no change.

the drive is the same drive I used in the 9900k system, and it had zero issues there for months.

I also tried disconnecting my USB hubs, that has a different issue  as well, neither of my ""gen2"" USB ports work, the usb C or the A, both just won't detect anything, and I cannot find any other driver besides the generic AMD usb one.

Heat is not an issue, max the CPU gets is around 65, GPU around 60.

drives are also around 30.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what to do, a reboot helps for about 10 minutes, then it goes back to it's annoying crap stutter that it does, if you hit next background, the mouse will completely lag out for about 2 seconds.

And any game I play is fine, until physics need to be calculated, then it craps the bed.

Is the CPU just bad?

641,QUESTION: Mixing RAM speeds. Please read,"Currently I have 2x8GB of RJV @ 2133. I'm feeling the lack of RAM lately, especially with modded games. I'm looking at getting:  Aorus 2x8GB @ 3200 RGB kit. It's pretty cheap and lately been having good experience with Aorus. Aside from that, I want to step up to 32GB full stop. I am confident and I'm ready to pay for it. But I'm question whether I should get a whole new kit altogether or if it will be fine mixing these two kits. I don't know much about RAM and the crap behind it. So I'm not sure if I can make the aorus kit a dual channel config or quad or whatever. If my PC will even post with the different ram kits or if I should just go up to 3200 all around.

Points to consider:

\- I have an i5 8600k @ 4.8Ghz - I have an aorus motherboard, specifically the Gaming Ultra 2.0 (z370) - Since my current RAM was RMA'd I am not sure of it's exact specs (First off, I originally had a 2400mhz kit before it died and got replace with a 2133mhz kit which btw actually shits itself when I try to overclock) - I wouldn't mind replacing the RipJaws V later down the line with another kit

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, would there be any issue with getting a 2x8GB @ 3200mhz kit to go with my 2x8GB @ 2133mhz kit. What will be the case for dual channel mabobs.

So I was thinking of getting a Model-O but something really got into my head.

I could share it sometimes with my younger sibling so I thought of how careless he is about these stuff and I got nervous about the holes in the mouse and water.


So, Is it possible in any way I make it semi waterproof just so I can still have a chance to remove any water before it gets to its core and it all goes to shit?

I was thinking of deforming it and add some transparent plastic cover from its inside just so it covers the mouse from any liquids and still have the cool lighting and could add a gram or two.
So, Is this possible or does anyone have better ideas?

My system runs well, especially at 1080P 
I average 150+ FPS on most games
But I am looking for a little more performance. 

I know overclocking is limited due to my motherboard, and my GPU is definitely lower end.

My question is should I Focus on a graphics card upgrade, and wait until I’m ready for a new CPU 
to also upgrade my motherboard, or should I get a higher end motherboard and try to pull some more performance from my CPU by overclocking, and upgrade my GPU in the next 5-6 months? 

Any advice is appreciated!

708,So... I Dropped my PC... Help?,"Here's a story followed by a question. So, earlier tonight, I was minding my own business playing through the Citadel DLC for Mass Effect 3 while in a Discord call with a friend. Everything was as it should be. Then by a twist of fate, I somehow leaned in my chair at an exact angle that would make me fall over. Not a big deal, it happens sometimes. Problem is, I tried to grab my desk to stop my fall as I was falling. Not only did it not stop my fall, I missed my desk completely and whacked the hell out of my PC. As I fell to the floor, I heard my PC hit the floor too. My heart sank. My gaming PC, my pride and joy had hit the floor from about 4 feet off the ground. In a craze of anxiety, I opened the side panel on my PC to make sure everything inside was okay. At a quick glance everything looks as it should. Suprisingly, none of my cords except my DisplayPort fell out (I had a wired mouse and keyboard as well as 2 Xbox controllers plugged in and my power supply plugged into the wall). After some quick testing everything seems to be working as it should and I haven't restarted my PC yet. Any advice on how to make sure everything is working as it should? I know everything is probably fine, but I'd much rather be 100% sure everything is okay.",6,9,APerfectRoll,0,dropped pc help,story followed question earlier tonight minding business playing citadel dlc mass effect 3 discord call friend everything twist fate somehow leaned chair exact angle would make fall big deal happens sometimes problem tried grab desk stop fall falling stop fall missed desk completely whacked hell pc fell floor heard pc hit floor heart sank gaming pc pride joy hit floor 4 feet ground craze anxiety opened side panel pc make sure everything inside okay quick glance everything looks suprisingly none cords except displayport fell wired mouse keyboard well 2 xbox controllers plugged power supply plugged wall quick testing everything seems working restarted pc yet advice make sure everything working know everything probably fine much rather 100 sure everything okay,dropped pc help ,drop pc help ,drop pc help ,dropped pc help ,drop pc help ,drop pc help

746,Worthwhile build?,"I was thinking of building a very compact Mini-ITX PC inside of an old thin client case.
The particular case is one from the FSC S500, which has no replaceable IO shield, although that should be pretty easy to mod, as well as a LP single slot PCI-e slot parallel with the motherboard, in which i was thinking of fitting something like an MSI LP RX550.
As far as i can tell the case should fit a Mini-ITX mobo like a glove with a pico PSU.
So the main question is, i want to build this thing on a very tight budget, for about 350 USD i was able to find these parts on eBay (shipping included) :

-S500 Case: 31$
-Asus H61 Mini-ITX MB: 50$
-i5-3470s: 38$
-1x8GB DDR3L Ram: 36$
-250w PicoPSU*: 18$
-RX550 LP: 155$
-1155 Stock Cooler (with copper slug): 10$
-PCI-e Riser: 6$

Question is, are these specs worth the money? Of course i am losing a lot thanks to the form factor, but considering the fact that the case is smaller than an A4 paper, i think it'd be great since it can just fit in a backpack with a mouse and keyboard, and would probably pull games like CSGO, Lol, and other staple LAN titles without much of a problem. 
Opinions?
As far as storage goes, i have a 120gb m-sata ssd in an adapter board that could just be zip-tied somewhere in the case.

Just depends on what you all think is going on here. I don't have a cooler yet, because I'm not sure what to be looking for or if I even need one.

I'm completely new to building a computer. I've had alienware laptops for the last decade and finally at a point in my life I can sit down at a desk and the set up will stay in place. Any comments or suggestions here are very much welcomed. I'd like to leave myself open for updates or changes, but probably going to stick with this for a long time.

I don't do crazy gaming right now because I don't have the time, but may get into stuff as my life settles down. Just let me know if I'm super overpowered or under-powered anywhere and should even it out. Thanks for your help!

777,"New Mobo, CPU, and RAM, Windows no longer genuine, low frames on games","Hello, I recently upgraded my PC and game fps performance has dropped as well as my Windows Version is no longer marked as a genuine copy.  
I will specify my pre-upgrade specs, and post upgrade specs.  


Pre-upgrade:  
ASUS Sabertooth Z77  
I7-3770k  
Zotac RTX 2060  
32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 RAM  


Post-upgrade:  
MSI MAG Z390 Tomahawk  
I5-9600k  
Zotac RTX 2060  
16 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM  


Here are some FPS benchmarks and comparisons for my 2 builds on 3 separate games:  
Pre-upgrade: (I thought that my CPU was bottle-necking my GPU, that was my original reason for upgrading.) !ALL GAMES WERE RUN ON LOWEST SETTINGS WITH NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL TUNED FOR MAX PERFORMANCE!  
55-65 fps on Hunt: Showdown  
60-70 fps on Rainbow Six: Siege  
50-60 fps on Escape From Tarkov  
Post-upgrade:  
45-55 fps on Hunt: Showdown  
50-60 fps on Rainbow Six: Siege  
45-55 fps on Escape From Tarkov  
CPU Temps were 30-40 degrees Celsius before and after upgrade. I am scared to overclock as I have never done it before and I know it can fry CPUs and Mobos.  


Additionally, Microsoft settings say that my Windows 10 Home version is not genuine, when I did have a genuine version before upgrading.  
For this issue I have tried contacting Microsoft support and troubleshooted using Windows settings.  
I told Microsoft support that I replaced my Mobo and they said that since the OEM license was on the old Mobo, I must purchase a new licence to operate Win 10. That seems like a legitimate solution in my opinion, (but my budget can't be stretched any further after recent upgrades).  
I have also tried using a manual rearm through command prompt.  


The main request that I have is how I should go about upping my frames (This is most important to me!) and possibly fixing the issue I am having with Windows.  
Should I overclock my CPU? Buy a new version of Windows even though I already have it?

I made a huge mistake. I mistook the 6x2 PCIe cable for the CPU one. I've run the PC for several hours already and while I've had several problems, the PC still boots and the pins on the motherboard seem to be intact although the plastic on the header was bent slightly (will provide pictures).

What I want to know is what kind of consequences should I be worried about and how can I test for them?

Also, is it safe to continue using this PC after switching the 6x2 to the 4x4 extension?

Note, I DID NOT make this same mistake with the cable I plugged into the PSU. That cable was clearly labelled CPU and I used that.

I understand that this was an incredibly stupid mistake, I really just want to fix it.

862,Average FPS drop over time,"Hey guys, I don't know if this is the right spot to ask this, but I'm out of ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed recently that average FPS in the games I played dropped dramatically.

I'm using NZXT's CAM for monitoring, along with in-game FPS counter from Nvidia.

Rocket League is the game I used to play with 250 fps, with rare dips to 240... Now, my average FPS is 141.

I've tried everything. DDU, windows reinstall (didn't format the hard drive though), all driver reinstall... I'm legit out of ideas what could cause it. My temperatures are fine, GPU rarely goes over 60c, CPU I can't remember when it went over 60c. It came to the point where that FPS is making the games I play unplayable. It happens with Trackmania 2 stadium as well. From stable 150 (fixed in game) to drops that make the game averaging on 132.

Also, whenever my PC goes to sleep, I can't wake it up.. Monitor is displaying the black screen, so my only solution is to hold the power button until it reboots... It reboots in post, forcing me to go to bios.

When I boot it up, GPU Tweak says ""Load vendor.dll Fail. Please install VGA driver"". So, what I do is press shut down from the sign-in screen, and then boot the PC normally. This also happens with regular restarts, and I didn't install anything that would make me believe it would cause it. Just randomly started happening.

I don't know if these two issues are correlated, but they just as well may be.

I tried reinstalling drivers, reinstalling Windows (just the windows installation), system file checker... Everything I could've thought of... My last resort is doing a clean install, but I'm really trying to avoid this because I have a couple of work-related databases set in my SQL Server and they are a pain in the ass to set up.

Any suggestion would do. If you guys can think of anything else I can do to diagnose the issue - please say. :)

The temps went down (GPU at about 70 celsius, CPU 45-50) and I hoped the problem was fixed. However today it crashed once again and now it won´t reboot. When I turn it on only the power supply fan starts and the frontpanel USB ports are on. No other fan (including CPU fan) starts or the graphics card. I tried rebooting it with only the internal graphics card but that didn't work either. Is this most likely a motherboard problem or a CPU problem? Any help is much appreciated. I really don't wanna start playing on a console...

So I've been on the market to a new monitor setup. Im coming from 3 27"" (all 144hz 1440p) with a 24""(144hz) on the top tilted down. I use this setup for trading, browsing, communications and some gaming. I recently got a 49"" monitor but I just which they were a little bigger height-wise. This led me to start looking for a tv as a monitor. These are the ones Im currently eyeing:

TCL | [55R625](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V5WY147) | 550 | 120

&amp;nbsp;


I know I cant get a TV to be as fast as my monitors, but I want it to be as close as possible to it. Also, I have an AMD build, so Freesync is to be considered (even tho most new tvs have freesync?)


&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I really wanted a 49"" or even 43"" tv. But anything under 55"" is 60hz. Idk what's behind that but whatever. Which would you choose out of the bunch? Im open to suggestions, ESPECIALLY from TV-monitor users.

901,Need to undo CPU overclock,"I did not build my PC nor did I overclock it, it was bought used and already overclocked. Once in a while it would have a blue screen error but it has always been very rare until recently when I began gaming on it.

The PC parts are:
Ryzen 7 1700 clocks to 3798-3799Mhz, default is 3800Mhz. MSI B350 Tomahawk. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 clocks to 1202Mhz.

My temperature rarely exceeds the mid 50s but in moments of stress can hit 70.

So I'm also asking for theories as to why it may be crashing aside from being overclocked. However, assuming that overclocking is the likeliest culprit then I need to revert it back to stock. 

I use the computer for audio mixing and gaming, in other words, it gets abused to the brink of its capacity for hours every day. That said, with games in only high settings at 60 frames and for what I am demanding with it from audio, I'm not asking too much from my components, and even if I were asking too much it should only lag or have an app crash not have a full on blue screen error.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",0,5,Sophonautt,0,need undo cpu overclock,build pc overclock bought used already overclocked would blue screen error always rare recently began gaming pc parts ryzen 7 1700 clocks 3798 3799mhz default 3800mhz msi b350 tomahawk nvidia geforce gtx 1080 clocks 1202mhz temperature rarely exceeds mid 50s moments stress hit 70 also asking theories may crashing aside overclocked however assuming overclocking likeliest culprit need revert back stock use computer audio mixing gaming words gets abused brink capacity hours every day said games high settings 60 frames demanding audio asking much components even asking much lag app crash full blue screen error help would greatly appreciated,need undo cpu overclock ,nee undo cpu overclock ,need undo cpu overclock ,need undo cpu overclock ,nee undo cpu overclock ,need undo cpu overclock

My MASTERLIQUID ML240L doesn't seem to be cooling as well as it should be anymore I noticed after using the PC for a bit the temp would keep rising far higher then it should be if it was cooling properly. Even as I type this the cpu is at 75c and Im idle.

&amp;#x200B;

Would this explain the issues im having?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: PC shut off time went from a couple seconds to 12-20 seconds, Folders which didn't even take a second to open now take two And bigger items likewise went from a couple seconds, to about 15+ seconds.

Everything is up to date, ~~Cpu Temp is showing normal~~. Had the PC for a little over a year, it gets turned off daily. Running Windows 10. SSD is healthy(WD ssd dashboard says so anyway.)

The build was put together last week. When running Forza Horizon 4 at 1080, theres no issues but when running at 4k the GPU fans spin up to 100%, making a sound like it's going to take off, and when it hits 70⁰c it just completely shuts down, no blue screen. I've been told these cards can run as high as 110⁰c so not convinced heat is an issue. The only other game tested is Dirt 2.0 with the same result.

So far I've checked the CPU cooler is seated properly, rolled back the GPU drivers to 19.6.2 (saw somewhere on reddit these are stable, and the GPU did last longer before shutting down), checked and underclocked the ram to 2800mhz.

I'm inclined to believe it's the PSU as the highest draw from the GPU was very high (can't remember exact numbers).

972,I prefer the Macbook Pro 2018 over my Razer Blade 15,"Hey, y'all. I am a programming student and purchased a Razer Blade 15 (i7, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD, GTX 1060) for both it's power and build quality. Recently I have had the opportunity to use a 2018 13' Macbook Pro (i7, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD, Intel Iris Pro Graphics) that is basically spec for spec, sans the graphics card, with my Razer. I never expected to like it as much as I have! Apple's build quality and small attention to detail are certainly noticeable, with a robust yet minimal appearance. It feels equal part art and tool, and is very much welcome with the quasi-embarrassment sharing code with actual professionals with something that has a giant green logo on the lid. The speaker's clarity and bass levels are remarkable for the petite size and while the keyboard is a little bit of a low point and probably the worst part of the machine for me, I actually found the touch bar kinda handy in certain applications. I do prefer to have USB 3.0 ports on my machines for convenience, but being able to charge through ANY USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 power adapter through ANY of the available ports is such a convenience in itself that I think I could live with a dongle. Probably the point that I was the most impressed with is the standby time. The first time I had gotten busy and didn't use the machine for like 5 days and then open it up to see ""20%"" next to the battery icon honestly was such an eye-opening moment for me. I am nervous to go anywhere with my Razer without the power brick, as not only is the battery life not the most impressive even after a pretty aggressive undervolt but the standby time is absolutely abysmal if you leave any kind of program open. That’s not even taking the large size of the power adapter as well. 

Now that it's been over a year since I purchased the Blade and I've since built a gaming desktop of considerably more power than my Blade could ever have, I've been so impressed that I may sell the Blade once the rumored 13' with the 16' redesign drops sometime later this year given what I've read. It solves my main issue with the shallow keyboard, and would open up not only macOS knowledge but also Apple device development along with all the things I do now on Windows through Bootcamp and Parallels Desktop whose coherence mode impressed me so much that I audibly screamed. I didn't understand why the Mac community was so tight-knit and passionate about this platform until I got to use one, now I'm happy to say I'm one of those passionate members.

* Primarily doing video game emulation.
* Garage Band possibly Logic, Fruity Loops, Ableton, FL Studio (have a lot to research still) 

According to my friends, both should do the job, but in regards to ease of set up, the Mac Mini seems like all id have to do is pop some ram in and put in an SSD and call it a day, 

With the Pro, it has more ram slots and uses cheaper to buy ram from what I see. My friend also tells me that it will be able to thread or muti process?

I'm currently running a 2012 Mac Book Pro, 2.5Ghz Intel Core i5, 16GB of Ram, with an SSD, it hasn't let me down so far, but that being said I haven't really pushed it as far as I plan with the other one.

one thing that I do need it Bluetooth and an HDMI port, which the Mac Pro doesn't have.

I'm pretty sure both can do what I need but considering I can get either for close to the same price, what direction should I go, what will last me the longest without having to change things?

What I'm looking at

Mac Mini 2012 $190

* Mac Mini Late 2012
* I5 2.5G2.5Ghz
* 8Gb Ram (Plan to Upgrade to 16GB)
* 500GB HD (Plan to Upgrade to SSD)

Mac Pro 2009 $180

* Apple A1289 Mac Pro 4,1 (flashed to 5,1 for installing macOS High Sierra)
* Quad-Core Intel Xeon 2.66GHz CPU
* 16GB DDR3 Memory (having the option to add more)
* 1TB Hard Drive (*Might* upgrade to SSD if I feel it is too slow) 
* Apple NVidia GT120 512MB Video Card
* Include Keyboard and Mouse
* No Wifi, No Bluetooth, No HDMI
* 30 Days Warranty

985,Any major differences between iMac French vs English?,"I am looking at picking up an iMac and I found this one for $400 OFF at Best Buy:

Apple iMac (MNE02C/A) 21.5"" Intel Core i5 Dual-Core 7th Gen 3.4GHz Computer - French

The specs check off all the boxes that I am looking for except the machine is listed as French.

Are there any major differences (other than keyboard) or can I just simply switch the OS to English and save $400?

I am okay with purchasing a new keyboard later on if need be but as far as I can tell the Canadian French keyboard is a QWERTY keyboard instead of AZERTY so if the extra buttons are that much of a pain I'll buy a new keyboard.

The English version of this computer is significantly more expensive so if it's just about buying a keyboard I still end up a net winner.

987,Buying a Mac Without Apple Care. The Best Way to Do This.,"For a lot of people, buying a Mac can be pricey enough.  Then at checkout, you get asked about Apple Care.  Knowing that you're spending a good chunk of change, you may have declined it.  If this is you, you're not the only one.  That what I did when I bought my 2016 Macbook Pro.  If you are going to be making this purchase, use a credit card that offers ""Extended Manufacturer Warranty"".

**How it Works**

Many credit cards have a benefit built into the credit card called ""Extended Manufacturers Warranty"".  As long as you make the purchase on your credit card, if the US Manufacturers warranty is 1 year to 3 years, the protection extends the warranty an additional year.  If you Mac suffers an issue outside of Apple's warranty, but, within the additional 1-year benefit, you can make a claim with the credit card company to have your Mac fixed.  In most cases, you'll need:

* The receipt
* A copy of the credit card statement showing the purchase you made.
* A copy of Apple's warranty.
* A quote from Apple or, an authorized Apple repair facility to fix the issue. 

**What happened to me**

I purchased a 2016 Macbook Pro. I used my Chase Bank Freedom Unlimited credit card (this is not an endorsement for Chase Bank, I am merely sharing my experience using this card's benefit and overall ease of process).  A year went by with no problems.  After the 1 year mark, my screen started going dim in some areas.  I contacted the benefit number for the credit card on a Monday.  I made a claim to get my screen fixed.  I was told I needed to submit the information listed above.  I got this done later that day.  On Wednesday, I was told I'm good to go and they'll be sending me a check in the mail for the cost of the repair.  Apple quoted me $750 to replace the screen.  I got a check in the mail for the amount the same week on a Saturday.  I had my computer repaired.  

It was a surprisingly easy experience and a great alternative for people who do not purchase Apple Pay.  I hope this helps you.

I ran a hardware test in the morning and it came up with no errors. I’ve lightly used it today (to check emails and back it up) and it seems to be fine, and no smell. 

Other details: It was running an intense program at the time this happened so I was concerned that maybe something was overloaded. I also did not hear the fan running so I thought maybe the fan broke and it was overheating, but today when using it the fan did seem to be working. 

My question is: should I take it into a shop for a look over? If my hardware test came out fine would theirs be any different? Is it worth the money for the peace of mind? Is this burning smell serious or does it happen sometimes?

1010,$1500 budget for video editing macbook - what would you recommend?,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the market for a new laptop, preferably a macbook to use for Video editing. My primary resolutions are for 1080p, but I want to be future-proofed for when I make the jump to 4k. Currently, I'm on an old, 2011 macbook pro so pretty much anything is an upgrade.

Additionally, I've now begun to work with a production company as an intern on a part-time basis. They've given me an iMac in their office that I can use with them occasionally, but realistically they have suggested it'd be best to get my own computer to work from for the future. They're a small team and don't really have extra computers kicking around for the intern to use. My work with them deals a lot in sony and RED 4k formats on decently complex timelines, so, I'd kind of like a machine to be able to handle these (with proxies is fine), in premiere pro. I'd like to use Mac OS because that seems to be standard for the production companies in my area.

Am I asking too much to look for a new or used Macbook in the $1500 range that can do these things? What specs should I look for? Or should I just spring for the new 16"" by financing it over 12-24 months and call it a day?",1,14,euaeuo,1,1500 budget video editing macbook would recommend,hey everyone market new laptop preferably macbook use video editing primary resolutions 1080p want future proofed make jump 4k currently old 2011 macbook pro pretty much anything upgrade additionally begun work production company intern part time basis given imac office use occasionally realistically suggested best get computer work future small team really extra computers kicking around intern use work deals lot sony red 4k formats decently complex timelines kind like machine able handle proxies fine premiere pro like use mac os seems standard production companies area asking much look new used macbook 1500 range things specs look spring new 16 financing 12 24 months call day,1500 budget video editing macbook would recommend ,1500 budget video edit macbook would recommend ,1500 budget video edit macbook would recommend ,1500 budget video editing macbook would recommend ,1500 budget video edit macbook would recommend ,1500 budget video edit macbook would recommend

1021,Is the 2019 MacBook Air for me?,"[Nearly a month ago, I posted a thread asking for suggestions on what new MacBook model should budget for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/egowby/suggestions_for_a_new_macbook/) I'm a university student (junior) studying journalism, although I'm hoping to do a lot more web/print design (some light graphic design.) My current computer has been acting up and I've started budgeting for a replacement. I spend a lot of my ""serious"" time using Adobe InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. I mostly do light graphics - I don't really do any 3D graphics rendering or anything. In my spare time I do play Minecraft, but that is the extent of the gaming I do on my computer.

Probably the most strenuous task I do from time to time is video work. I do work with 4K footage in Adobe Premiere Pro from time to time, although not that often and I usually don't go crazy with effects or anything.

In that previous thread, I came to the 13"" MBP. However, recently I've been under a lot of financial stress so I'm looking at the cheapest yet most reliable/dependable option. I've owned refurbished computers in the past and never had much good luck with them in terms of longevity, and in particular with a MacBook I'm worried about the butterfly keyboards. I'm also more-less set on a Mac; I currently have a PC and I really want a computer that does what I need it to do without stressing me out with constantly having to find drivers, fiddle with settings, etc.

The model I'm currently eyeing is the $1299 model with 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage and the Intel Core i5 clocked at 1.6GHz. While this isn't the model that I'd go for (8GB seems fairly limiting, and I would like to go for the better display and graphics the MBP but I'm also in sort of a budget crunch) I'm also trying to find the cheapest option.

I do have some questions:

1. Would the $1299 model fit my needs? Would it be able to do the day-to-day stuff like working with InDesign/Photoshop/Illustrator, and would it be capable to play Minecraft in my downtime? How would such a machine perform in Premiere Pro?
2. What is the current generation butterfly keyboard like? I heard Apple will replace the 3rd generation butterfly keyboards in newer machines with the Magic Keyboard if the butterfly keyboard fails - is this true?
3. I heard heat can cause issues with the MBA, specifically possibly damaging the hardware. Should I be overly concerned about this?
4. Are there any other suggestions out there? I've been tracking Apple's refurbished site to see what sort of machines they're selling and the price point on them, but I'm also worried about the issues they had with the previous generations of butterfly keyboards.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who responded. It looks like it would be a bad idea to purchase a MacBook Air for my usage case, especially right now.

With that said, I'm probably going to wait until June/July and see what new Macs are released then. I'm hoping they release the updated 13"" (which, from what I've heard, could be bumped up to 14"") MBP with 256GB SSD standard on the base model and the scissor keyboard mechanism. That'd be awesome because I'm really wanting to shoot for a machine with 16GB RAM, but I **need** at least 256GB storage. The better display and graphics performance is also a great plus for me since I'm working with graphics, but I'm also used to working with non-retina/older LCD monitors so it's not a deal killer. But perhaps the most important to me is the keyboard reliability and reliability of the whole machine. I'm a broke college student who can't afford to purchase a new computer often, so I need any computer I purchase to last a good while. AppleCare+ is a good idea, but I'm not sure if I could afford that.

As for going for the 16"" MBP, I've heard awesome thing about that model. It seems like the 16"" is the way to go if you have the money because Apple has perfected a lot of things on it to make it a more reliable and appealing machine, but it's *way* out of my current price range.

Perhaps waiting for June/July will be the best option because not only will the updated models be out, but it'll give me some time to save some more money and potentially purchase a better spec'd machine.",5,6,gf99b,1,2019 macbook air,nearly month ago posted thread asking suggestions new macbook model budget https www reddit com r mac comments egowby suggestions new macbook university student junior studying journalism although hoping lot web print design light graphic design current computer acting started budgeting replacement spend lot serious time using adobe indesign photoshop illustrator mostly light graphics really 3d graphics rendering anything spare time play minecraft extent gaming computer probably strenuous task time time video work work 4k footage adobe premiere pro time time although often usually go crazy effects anything previous thread came 13 mbp however recently lot financial stress looking cheapest yet reliable dependable option owned refurbished computers past never much good luck terms longevity particular macbook worried butterfly keyboards also less set mac currently pc really want computer need without stressing constantly find drivers fiddle settings etc model currently eyeing 1299 model 8gb ram 256gb ssd storage intel core i5 clocked 1 6ghz model go 8gb seems fairly limiting would like go better display graphics mbp also sort budget crunch also trying find cheapest option questions 1 would 1299 model fit needs would able day day stuff like working indesign photoshop illustrator would capable play minecraft downtime would machine perform premiere pro 2 current generation butterfly keyboard like heard apple replace 3rd generation butterfly keyboards newer machines magic keyboard butterfly keyboard fails true 3 heard heat cause issues mba specifically possibly damaging hardware overly concerned 4 suggestions tracking apple refurbished site see sort machines selling price point also worried issues previous generations butterfly keyboards input would greatly appreciated thanks edit thanks everyone responded looks like would bad idea purchase macbook air usage case especially right said probably going wait june july see new macs released hoping release updated 13 heard could bumped 14 mbp 256gb ssd standard base model scissor keyboard mechanism awesome really wanting shoot machine 16gb ram need least 256gb storage better display graphics performance also great plus since working graphics also used working non retina older lcd monitors deal killer perhaps important keyboard reliability reliability whole machine broke college student afford purchase new computer often need computer purchase last good applecare good idea sure could afford going 16 mbp heard awesome thing model seems like 16 way go money apple perfected lot things make reliable appealing machine way current price range perhaps waiting june july best option updated models give time save money potentially purchase better spec machine,2019 macbook air ,2019 macbook air ,2019 macbook air ,2019 macbook air ,2019 macbook air ,2019 macbook air

1043,8GB or 16GB for my needs.,"I’m asking a question that is asked fairly regularly after searching it on google. I’m asking if I should return my 8GB 13 inch MacBook Pro that I bought last week and trade it in for the 16GB version. I figured that maybe r/Mac could help me out because I’m new to the Mac world. I don’t know if I’m having buyers remorse or just worried about the future but I don’t want to gimp myself if I look back because this is a big purchase for me. At home I have a home desktop that’s decked out for gaming 9700k 32gb ram etc, etc for reference. 


I got my MacBook because I’m going back to online college and needed something to type up word documents or look at slideshows for my flight school. I also have an iPad Pro 11inch and while it’s awesome I really didn’t like the typing experience which is why I landed with a MacBook. 

So what do I generally do on my Mac? 

Well I type documents, look at slideshows, maybe dabble in Xcodr a little. I also like to play some games. So like WoW for world questing and stuff. I tried it on the Mac the other day it was ok for when I travel. I don’t really see myself using my Mac for other things than work related stuff and maybe the occasional game here and there. 

Does it even make sense to get the 16GB model or will I be okay with the 8GB. I don’t plan on buying another laptop for a couple years maybe 4-5 years.

Hi! So I upgraded my 13” MacBook Pro mid-2014 to Catalina a few weeks ago and i am kinda regretting it.

Everything feels clearly much more sluggish than before the upgrade and the wacom tablet driver has some pretty big problems (occasionally slows down, missing inputs and then going wild trying to catch-up with my sending my mouse all over the screen)

Also the whole new permission system is very Vista like. (If there would be a fix to simply bring it back to what the previous version used to do it would be perfect!)

Because all of this, should I downgrade to a previous version or just wait for a while untill they fix all the issues.

I have kept regularly time machine backups so downgrading *should* be easy but then again I dont really fancy trying to recover new files.

I’m considering upgrading from snow leopard to high Sierra (the latest supported version) but the only reason I’m hesitant is because I might will lose the cool Front Row function and the ir reciever would potentially not work, making it useless as a home theater pc.

1110,Extremely Slow iMac and Other Issues,"Hey all, I have an iMac with 8GB of RAM, Core i5 3.1Ghz, 1TB HD with 500GB free on Mojave 1.14.

It's experiencing a massive slowdown issue and boot problems with safe mode. I ran a system diagnostics and it came back with a system OK code of ADP000. I also ran a boot time disk first aid and the hard drive came back green check as no issues found.

However, the system definitely is not alright.

It won't boot to safe mode, get's about 85% of the way then freezes on the Apple logo and progress bar. I have to abort safe mode every time and power cycle.

Normal boot is very slow and takes about 5 minutes, and I can sign in after that. But using it is pathetically slow on all functions, apps, etc. even system utilities.

I can't back it up because Time Machine is copying at a snails pace. In about 2 hours it has managed to copy off 124MB of over 400GB of data to a USB 3 attached drive. This would take months to backup at this rate.

I dumped all of the startup items and have rebooted, that didn't make any difference. I removed Malwarebytes and rebooted, again no help. Activity monitor shows CPU average at 8% use, memory only 60% used, and disk usage very low.

Any ideas of what's causing such a massive slowdown?

The storage analyzer shows IOS files taking 194GB and SYSTEM files taking 182GB, so I'm not sure if this is overloaded with crud and if I can somehow speed it up by cleaning somehow?

Could it possibly be a hard drive issue even though both above mentioned diagnostics came back clean?

1111,How can I unmount a WD MyBook desktop drive so I can back up with Time Machine?,"I just purchased my 3rd Western Digital My Book Desktop Drive. Previously, I've used Time Machine to do backups on these drives and had no issues. Since I got a new one, I want to start backing up to this drive instead of the other one I'm currently using!

When I go to Time Machine to switch drives, it asks me if I want to erase, I click ""erase"" (totally fine because it's brand new and has nothing on it yet), and then it pops up with a window that says ""there was an error preparing the Time Machine backup disk, couldn't unmount disk"". So then I go to Disk Utility, go to the new drive, click ""erase"" (thinking this should wipe it and reformat it for my Mac), and it fails again because it can't unmount the disk (code -69888). I even tried erasing it and choosing the format of the other drive I currently back up to, which is Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and that didn't work. 

How can I format this new hard drive to work for a Time Machine backup? My other MyBook drive works just fine and I don't remember having this issue when I got it and set it up for backing up.

I need a cheaper way to be able to also insure it and have it come pristine and perfect. What kind of packaging or bags would you guys recommend? I would prefer not to pay like $500 on a bag... I just want my iMac to be safe and sound over the journey.

Could I not wrap it up like crazy and stamp “fragile” all over it and check it in as checked baggage at Air Canada? I know this long boi isn’t gonna fit in the overheads either.

1133,[PROBLEM] Installing Catalina on unsupported Mac," Hello, guys! I recently got an iMac 8.1 from a friend of mine, which had El Capitan OS. I've downloaded dosdude1's catalina patcher and installed it. I turned on my mac holding the option key.

So today, I've downloaded El Capitan with file extension .dmg on my windows 10 and copied it on a flash drive. I've put the flash drive in my Mac, but nothing is showing. Inside this .dmg file, there's a file named InstallMacOSX.pkg, which I have to install, but I don't have an OS on my Mac, so I was looking for a way to install it somehow on my windows and after that put all the files in the flash drive (I guess that's how it should be done), but I don't really know how to do it or if that's the right way. I also tried the command-option-R known as internet recovery, but nothing is happening (maybe, because of the old system).

1144,Long Repair Center Times,"Long AppleCare Repair Time?

Hi all, in November 2018 I bought a 2018 Macbook Pro (Vega 20, i9, ...) and have had it since. This past summer, I had to bring it in due to some issues that would pop up (screen shuttering, changing colors) and surprise surprise it was a bad GPU. That was the only issue at the time, and it took about 3 days after shipping off to get a logic board replacement and get it back. This August (maybe 3 weeks after the other repair) I noticed the laptop would occasionally get extremely hot (even with nothing running) and the fans would max out. It started happening while I was using just google docs on safari in class or something, so I tried restoring the OS and didn’t install anything (other than updates) for a few days. Still happened of course. I brought the laptop to  the Apple Store and the tech found nothing on diagnostics, but he still sent it for repair, and I got it back 4 days later with a new couple of fans, and hoped that was the resolution. Of course, I immediately noticed it would (randomly of course) do it still, but I couldn’t bring it back because I needed it for school. I tried to bring it back again in December after school was out, but I had to go out of town for a couple pf weeks and couldn’t be without it, so I finally dropped it off a little over two weeks ago. About a week ago I got an email saying they couldn’t find anything wrong, and I told them (as I had been told by another person with similar issues) that it could be T2 panics. I still have no update now, and I need this laptop as I’m a CS major. Does anyone know how I can get them to speed this up? 3 to 5 days is okay, but over two weeks now is not.

1151,Using a Mac for real work,"I work in IT and recently swapped my HP for an Apple. I have bought and used Macs for years. I used to be an Apple fanboy in my younger days, but I feel like they have been going downhill since 10.7. I have still kept some around the house, but mostly for my wife or just basic web browsing. For work I have always used Windows and more specifically an HP with Windows. Now I have no complaints about HP and I think Windows 10 is the best desktop OS we have seen to date. However, my work offers only a few standard options and the Mac offered a little more horsepower. I figured I would give it a shot and either wait for the next refresh cycle or request a non standard laptop if it doesn't work out.

There have been a few struggles getting this thing ""production ready"" but it's getting there. The number of dongles needed is pretty ridiculous. I knew this going in, but for people who travel to many different customer locations and need to be able to support all kinds of peripherals, it's a chore. The world still revolves around USB A whether we like it or not. Coming from a laptop with HDMI, VGA, USB A and USB C all just built in makes only having 2 USB C feel very handicapped. Not having native snapping for windows was like going back in time. Why doesn't Apple add this? I found an app named Magnet that solves this problem, but it should be native. I knew going in that Apple doesn't believe in docking stations for whatever reason, but I assumed 3 external displays wouldn't be a problem. This seems like it may have been a false assumption. I can get 2 externals working, but not 3. Seems strange as 2 externals and the internal display work just fine. Can I solve this with a Thunderbolt ""dock""? Do I need an external GPU? It does have a 3.5mm for audio so that's a plus.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr - 2017 MacBook Pro with 2 Thunderbolt Ports. I want to use 3 external displays. 2 x 1920x1080 and 1 2560x1080. Is this doable?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was able to make it work. I had one of these (See link below) laying around and now I have three externals and the internal. Not very elegant with having to daisy chain all of the dongles together, but it works.

1153,"Photo library gone after restoring from Time Machine (10.15.2, mid-2012 15” MBP)","Hi. I did a forum search before posting here but couldn’t find anything recent.

After restoring from a Time Machine backup of my MBP, everything appears back to “normal” except that my Photo library is totally gone. Nothing remains but the app. I never backed any photos up to iCloud, only to my MBP. Apologies if I’m not describing this well:

BACKGROUND
Recently, my MBP hard drive was full enough that it said I didn’t have room to backup my iPhone. So I backed up my MBP (Photo library intact here, and no backups to iCloud), then started deleting files to make room (movies, game downloads from Steam, and old podcasts). 

Soon I noticed that my MBP wouldn’t let me click on Security &amp; Privacy (within System Preferences) any longer. Concerned but unsure of how to fix, I stopped deleting files, and restored the MBP from this most recent Time Machine backup.

It took forever to finish, but things seemed back to how they were at the time of this last save (before I started deleting things). The only difference that I can detect is that my Photo library is completely gone.

The app is there, but that’s it, not even the names of any former albums. 

RIGHT NOW
When I open it, it just says “Restoring...” in the center of the screen, with an empty progress bar beneath it. Below that it says, “0% complete.”

(At the very bottom, it says, “iCloud Photos is not turned on. You can turn on iCloud Photos in Photos Preferences,” but again I never backed anything up to iCloud, only to my Mac via Time Machine.)

Any idea of what happened, and how I can fix it? There’s been no progress on the restoration since I opened the app roughly 1 hour ago.

1166,Tired of telemetry and privacy violations with Windows 10. Does Apple have telemetry as well? Considering switching over this. Help?,"So, after Windows 7 lost support this month, I’m left with the option of upgrading to Windows 10 or switching to Apple.

Basically, forced telemetry that I can’t turn off reliably (no third party software can’t guarantee it either) is a deal breaker for me at this point. 

I am considering switching to mac.

Does Apples OS have telemetry built into it and does it give you an option to turn it off? How does it compare to Windows “security - 0” option for telemetry?

Also, if apple does let you turn it off, how do you know for sure it is still not sending telemetry information?

Overall, I want an OS that respects my privacy and doesn’t use telemetry or lets me opt out. Is Mac OS that kind of OS and why if you believe so?

I have a 2015 27"" Retina iMac with the 6700K and 32GB RAM. The Fusion drive is showing its age and I recently got a 16"" MacBook Pro with the 9980H which is, as I just found out, significantly better even though it's in a laptop. I do music production and video editing so performance is a significant factor for me.

Aside from just selling my iMac, is there anything I could use it for when it's no longer in its prime? I would like to use it as an external display to my MacBook Pro but I don't think this is an option on the Retina iMacs (?). So I'm looking for ideas how to put it to good use while making the 16"" my daily driver.

Thanks in advance for any and all help :)",1,4,MirRelevant,1,retina imac old,hi 2015 27 retina imac 6700k 32gb ram fusion drive showing age recently got 16 macbook pro 9980h found significantly better even though laptop music production video editing performance significant factor aside selling imac anything could use longer prime would like use external display macbook pro think option retina imacs looking ideas put good use making 16 daily driver thanks advance help,retina imac old ,retin imac old ,retina imac old ,retina imac old ,retin imac old ,retina imac old

(I know a lot of people will tell me to just get an external hard drive but that leads into problem number 2). The USB inputs and outputs don't work (They randomly stopped working one day). It appears as though if something draws too much power, my Mac doesn't register it as plugged in. For example, I could plug my old iPhone 6 in and it would charge, plug in my iPhone 11 and it doesn't register as plugged in. The same goes for my music equipment. I took it to Apple and they said that it may be the motherboard but that they weren't sure. So the question is, would it be better in your opinion to upgrade the hard drive and get a new motherboard on my 2015 or wait 6 months to a year and hope that I don't lose my music in an effort to buy a ""new"" one.

1218,Bootcamp has serious RAM and CPU issues,"Heyo!

Been using bootcap for a few years now with little to no issues (except your general windows 10 bugs), but recently did a reinstall. And I've noticed that with only chrome and discord running, plus sharex, I'm already at 80-90% RAM usage. When I play the one game I installed bootcamp for, rocket league, I have to close down chrome and pray that it doesn't crash from low memory. On mac I can play rocket league perfectly fine, but it's missing some mods so I plan on remaining on bootcamp for now. Does anyone know where this CPU/RAM issue comes from? 

For reference I use a late 2017 13'', 8GB RAM, max CPU, 250GB SSD. When I check in task manager, the top tasks are usually taking up 300MB at most, with most apps being below 20MB. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/rmQTNqt.png) an example of high RAM, low CPU usage with only chrome and discord open.

I love this computer, especially because of the optical drive and abundance of ports. My love for it however doesn't fix it's issues. The screen is starting to glitch occasionally on the top left corner, it runs pretty hot (I use intensive programs like Final Cut and Logic, which take a few minutes to open), and some other small things. 

I was wondering how I can increase the lifespan of this little guy, not really ready to part ways with it. I upgraded to an SSD a few years ago and got it running a bit faster, I also swapped out the battery. Something might be wrong though because I can't click down on the upper left hand side of the trackpad, it feels the exact same pushing down on the aluminum casing. Should I go in there and check it out? It's a third-party battery.

Thinking of getting a mid-2015 15"" Macbook Pro (I can part ways with the optical drive, especially with the HDMI port on those things) or the new 16"" MacBook Pro, just not excited about becoming a dongler.

The ODD and CPU fan haven't gotten going. I can manually control them and when I do set them all to maximum, the CPU cools rapidly. I've got the CPU up to \~90 C and turned on ""Full Blast"" on Macs fan control, and within 5 minutes it's down to 47 C.

I'm not certain what the fan speed to temperature graph looks like, but it seems like the fans only really seem to speed up when it reached 90 C ish, which almost immediately brought it back down below their activate point.

My question is, Can someone advise me on whether this behaviour is intentional from the system and I just need to configure Macs fan control to speed up sooner, or whether some sensor may not be working? Thank you!

It has 2 whole gigs of RAM and 80GB HDD and Leopord! Holy shit it was nostalgia city turning this thing on. It seems to have been very rarely used as a sort of music server, and still runs surprisingly snappy except for copying files.

I was thinking of maybe using it as a Plex or Emby server, or something along those lines. The big issue is that this thing can't even load 98% of websites. TONS of HTTPS errors, weird funky things not loading, etc. I had to go waaaaay back and download an old version of chrome to even get chrome to install at all for some basic web access. Still tons of ""Your browser is out of date"" warnings when trying to do most tasks though. Even the oldest emby and plex server downloads I can find won't install, etc.

I thought maybe I could just run windows 10 off bootcamp, but bootcamp is version 2.0 which doesn't support it (I think, I don't have a windows 10 disc laying around and the installer is so old you can't use an ISO).

Is it worth it to update this from Leopard to maybe Lion? or Mavericks or even Yosemite? I think the latest supported version is Lion, but apparently it'll run at least Mavericks ok.

1277,Could a USB device cause external display issues?,"I have a 2019 16” MBP and I’ve been having an annoying problem with my external monitor. It works fine until the computer goes to sleep, then several hours later when waking it up, it won’t recognize the external display and I have to reboot in order for it to work. 

I’ve tested with multiple monitors and cables, HDMI and DisplayPort, and I always have the same issue. I reset the NVRAM, and also reset the SMC to no avail. 

So I took it to Apple and they ran diagnostics on it overnight. All diagnostics passed, they even did a wipe of my machine and were not able to reproduce the issue (I can reliably reproduce it every time). So after I picked it up, I left it for a couple hours and, lo and behold, the same issue. 

So I’m wondering if this could be caused by a USB device - the only thing that wasn’t present when testing at the Apple Store. 

I have a USB-C to USB-A cable which is connected to a USB hub. Connected to that hub is a USB external hard drive. 

I have disconnected those from my computer and it’s been several hours now without the problem, of course it may still happen as the timing is variable. I’m just wondering if anyone thinks this could be related or if I’m chasing a red herring.

from my searches I could find some high specs older iMacs (2010-2012), a really high end 2011 Mac Pro (32gb, Intel Xeon and etc) and some lower specs newer iMacs (2017 21.5"", i5, 8gb ram)

I pretty much only use safari to use streaming services since it supports 1080p but for some reason today it stopped working. It only plays sound and the subtitles are there but the screen is black.

When I try to install win the installation starts and works up to the point where windows gets actually installed. At about 50% the mac just shuts of, then restarts and boots in the windows partition where I get an error message that the installtion was interrupted or smth (I don't have a screenshot).

I'm totally new to Apple environment (come from linux). As my new work involve building for iOS plateform, i needed a macbook. I went for the Macbook 16 because i wanted to avoid old past keyboard (really did not like the fell of it) and also needed some horsepower for compiling and dedicated gpu for time off (some video games)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing really bothered me last time i took the train, i mostly use it plugged with an added screen but when i was on the go, coding some usual stuff under vscode while auto compile react-native was on, the battery only endured 2H on the train. First time i was using it unplugged.

&amp;#x200B;

I watch some reddit and added gfxCardStatus to track what gpu was in use (which be the way is supposed to give a way to use only integrated graphic that did not work ..) and saw that one my messaging app run on the big gpu which is stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

I m tryin to avoid to use it next time i'm on battery to see if it's better, but for the moment the estimation is only around 5hours which is far away from the 11h promised.

1317,"Could anybody help me with files management? Sorting, selecting and deleting duplicate files (sort of).","Hello community!  
I work as a nigh-time photographer. Every night I collect about 800 RAW files + 800 JPG files. I select my pictures selecting JPG files, that is to say I delete all the pictures I don't want, then I mark my JPG files with a grey tag and I transfer them into RAW files folder.   
In the final phase I have my original 800 RAW files + more or less 200 JPG tagged files in the same folder. I now have 200 JPG files matching exactly 200 of the 800 RAW-file names.  
I sort all my files in this folder by name and eventually I manually delete all the non duplicate files. The grey tags help me during this process: I leave each JPG file (with a grey tag) and its correspondent/matching RAW file (with the same name of the JPG) being right below the JPG.  
The screenshot at the bottom of this post shows this final phase

How can I automate my flow?  
Even with some Terminal steps it'd be fine.

1318,Washed out colors - USB-C to displayport cable,"I just bought a new monitor and a USB-C to displayport cable. Wen I connect the cable the colors are all washed out. Black is grey and so on. I don't have this issue with USB-C to HDMI. I have tried with another monitor. Here it works fine. The new monitor is 4K and the old i 1440p, so maybe that has something to do with it - Although the cable should support 4K/60HZ on both mac and windows.

The weird thing is that it works fine when I boot my mac in windows. I have tried to look at the setting on my mac and the monitor it self, but the settings are identical to the setting when i use HDMI - And changing the settings on the monitor doesn't help.

Any suggestions?

1331,Struggling to install the drivers for a generic Ethernet adapter on a Macbook Pro (2017) with Mac OS 10.14.6,"My friend keeps breaking her Ethernet adapters, so I advised her to order a generic Ethernet adapter off Aliexpress instead of spending $40 on a new Apple one every time. She ended up buying this [USB C to Ethernet Adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000012599448.html). Since I'm not too familiar with Mac, I expected it to work out of the box. As you might have guessed, I got proven wrong when the device arrived.

I found [this tutorial](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/214995/how-to-use-3rd-party-usb-ethernet-adapter-with-el-capitan) online, which describes the process of installing a generic Ethernet adapter driver on Mac OS. Instead of using the mentioned driver, I went to the Realtek website, downloaded [the latest driver](https://www.realtek.com/en/component/zoo/category/network-interface-controllers-10-100-1000m-gigabit-ethernet-usb-3-0-software) for her adapter's chipset (RTL8152) and installed it. Unfortunately, I'm not able to complete step #9 because the file  /System/Library/Extensions/USBCDCEthernet.kext doesn't exist on her device. I checked the Extensions directory for other Ethernet related files that could have been added by the Realtek driver installer, but ended up empty handed.

Could the required kext file be in a different location? What else could I try to make the adapter work?

Edit: I found the kext file under /Library/Extensions and followed the remaining steps. Unfortunately, the adapter still doesn't show up. Any suggestions?

When I'm under the direct sunlight the brightness, of course, goes to maximum level, but in a different way compared to when I'm not outside. The screen becomes covered from a White Patina as shoved in photo. I thought it was because of True Tone option, so I disabled it but this ""problem"" still here.

So my current PC is a 15 inch Dell Vostro and it's dying. The screen is off place (broken) and it's very slow in general. It's also pretty old now, so I am planning on buying a new PC. I've been a Linux user most of my life, Windows is not my thing. I looked up for a good choice, and the Macbook line immediately caught my eye. I am a programmer, so my main use cases are well, programming, web browsing, Netflix, and that's basically it. Screen size is not that improtant, 13' or 15' is fine. MacOS is Unix-like, like Linux, so I am feeling comfortable (and of course I can always install Linux on it anyways).
My only question is, which one to buy? As I understand, there are 3 main lines: Macbook, Macbook Air and Macbook pro. (Am I right? If not, please correct my on this one) Which one is the best for my needs? Should I purchase it online or find some Apple store in the city? Does it matter if it's an official Apple store or not?

1354,Adware and Anti-Malware/Anti-Virus for Yosemite? Is Total AV safe enough?,"I would tend to want to use Malwarebytes, but it seems it's for OS 10.11+, and we're looking at OS 10.10.5. Malwarebytes website seems to indicate version 3 will work with 10.10 and above in one place, but when you look at the system requirements page linked to from there it says 10.11 and above.      
       
I am trying to help a friend with Yosemite and apparent adware, possibly more on their Mac desktop. They thought they had anti-virus/anti-malware but that turned out to be on a different computer (Mac laptop).       
        
It seems the majority of the issue is in Chrome, and they have several extensions installed, most of which we disabled as they were reluctant to remove them completely.      
         
There has been an issue of additional tabs opening with prompts to install a file to PDF converter, but also other ads coming up more frequently than ""usual"". I have them using Safari in the meantime, and suggested they install the anti-virus/anti-malware they are used to from the other mac (laptop) and scan with that and see whether that finds anything. Then, if the problem persists, I said we'd probably want to entirely remove the Chrome extensions. But now they've installed a different anti-virus/anti-malware app and it seems iffy.      
          
There was also trouble installing Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, but I'm fairly certain that was an issue with the OS being only 10.10.5, and DC requires 10.12 apparently.           
             
They have McAfee on their Mac laptop, and I thought they were going to install that... but they apparently installed Total AV instead. I've heard/seen enough mixed reviews of Total AV that I'm dubious about recommending that... and they're asking me how to deal with some of the messages after they scanned with it.      
     
I have to admit, I've been mainly using Windows and Android for years recently. I used to be ambidextrous with OS's (Mac, Windows, Linux), but it's been a while... so I'm quite out of the loop in this regard for Macs. I can help them with software, browsing and general things, but when it gets to updates and security, I'm not really up to date on that for Mac, as those things change quickly.          
                    
I'm not sure if they want to upgrade their OS or if the computer is capable of that (can check when I am there again, but am really looking for a solution without that as I don't think they have backup capability currently, and that would get into a whole different can-o-worms to backup and update the OS). I'm thinking they probably should update their OS, but would rather not deal with that.

1366,Triple boot Catalina/Windows 10/Linux,"Hello,

I have a Macbook Pro 16 with Catalina as base OS and trying to triple boot. Drive is APFS. I installed Windows 10 with Bootcamp and then resized with Easeus Partition Master because shrink would not work in device management. I then had to edit the macOS partition with GDISK because EaseUS breaks some GPT ID which prevents booting in macOS.  Both OS now boot fine and I now have a 125GB unused partition for Ubuntu. I downloaded rEFInd, booted in macOS recovery and ran refind-install (which seem to do something in the terminal). I can still boot both OS without issue but nothing seemed to have changed after the rEFInd install script ran. Macbook still boots and work normally as a standard dual-boot macOS/Bootcamp device. Not sure what to do next.

Does anybody have tips triple booting on a macbook with APFS drive?  


EDIT: Disabling SIP and then running the rEFInd install gives me the following result. Both OS still work. I have to enter admin password to unlock the macOS drive, but still no rEFInd bootloader

1369,"I'm stupid, and spilt water on my friend's mac. Now the speaker's aren't working. What do I do?","I accidentally knocked a glass of water over, and it hit her computer. It was quite a little bit, as the glass was only about 1/5 full and the water mostly hit the table, stayed in the cup or her computer cover. What hit her computer came from the top right side, where the headphone jack sits, and where one of the speakers are. (She has gotten a rather new MacBook pro)

Well, the bit that got on her computer has ruined the speakers. I can't seem to figure out how, and everything else works as it should. The headphone jack does aswell. The speakers don't make a sound, not the sound from the computer nor a buzzing/sizzling sound.

I would really love to know how I, or we, fix it, and really how it happened, as I have spilt water on my MacBook Air, and nothing happened. It might just have been bad luck of course, but it might be the speaker placement.

I'm very lucky she has insurance, even though I dont know if it will cover all the expenses of getting either new speakers or a hole new computer. I don't know if I have to pay for anything yet, which I really hope not to. I would feel very bad burdening my parents with it. I am also only 17, so getting all that money would be quite hard if I'm honest.

I am desperately seeking advice! I have a Macbook Air (2015). It froze and then I manually turned it off and back on. Upon turning it back on, a folder with a blinking question mark was displayed which I understand indicates that it is having difficulty accessing the hard drive. I brought the computer to my university to get it serviced and they tried putting it into single user mode, cleaning dust from the hard drive and mounting the hard drive- none of these things worked and they recommended another company with more sophisticated technology to use. That company just called me back and said that the solid state drive has failed and areas of the hard drive are damaged. They are going to image the drive (areas that are good) and see what is possible to get back which they say will take about 4 hours and say that 3 out of 4 times they are able to retrieve some data. This is very costly and I am already at a loss financially. If what I stated above does not work is there anything else that can be done? Any and all help is welcomed- feeling devastated and at a loss, all of my work in on there for the past 5 years.

1405,An honest review of Phobio for Mac returns,"I decided to use the return feature on apple’s website to sell my 2017 MacBook Pro 13” that had recurring keyboard issues (shocking I know). The place that handles it by me is a company called Phobio. They offered me $1030 for the laptop and I jumped on it.

Naturally I looked them up a little too late because I implicitly trusted apple’s judgment when working with companies that interacted directly with their customers. What I found what unsettling to say the least. Lots of horror stories about them getting the laptops and claiming that they wouldn’t even turn on, etc. and offering people measly amounts of money or their newly broken laptop back.

I’m happy to report that I had a pretty good experience and am receiving  the full amount from them with no issues. The only thing that bugged me was how excruciatingly long it took. They received my device on the 3rd of January, it took them till the 7th to register it as “received”. From there it took them till the 14th to inspect it, and they just told me today on the 16th that it will take 3-5 business days to receive my payment via email. So far everything has taken the maximum amount of time it could have, so ultimately you’re looking at almost a month of wait time (shipped out December 28th) from the moment you send your laptop off.

Windows audio is a pain and Windows DPC is a double-pain, so I'm considering Mac for the first time. However, it seems that there was a T2 bug for USB2.0 interfaces in Mojave that was supposed to be fixed but is only partially fixed, and that there's a number of audio bugs in Catalina. What I couldn't find on forums was the extent of the issue. How are Mac users getting around this? Should I plan on installing Mojave rather than Catalina and use an adapter with my interface? Would that be sufficient? I'm tempted to look for a pre-T2 MacBook, but I'm not sure that would be supported by Apple.

1427,macOS Constantly Spinning Up External Hard Drive,"Alright, I'm about ready to throw this damn computer out the window. 

I've got a 2017 5k iMac with an external hard drive plugged in. The hard drive has all my photos and videos on it, but no installed software (because internal mac storage isn't sufficient for storing documents).

The problem is, my Mac keeps waking up the external hard drive every 7-10 minutes, which is really, really frustrating. If I extend the sleep time, the drive never sleeps, and if I leave it at the default of 5 minutes, it's constantly ramping down.

Using dtrace, it looks like it's Finder constantly doing stuff with the drive - mostly opening up Final Cut bundles and my photos library. This occurs even when no other software is running, and it's definitely Finder accessing these files.

Things I have tried:

* Disabling spotlight indexing on the drive
* Removing the drive from the Finder sidebar
* Disabling ""Recent Items"" in System Preferences (for a while it looked like the files Finder was accessing was related to the Recent Items list
* Removing my Photos library from the external drive

Finder isn't constantly accessing all files on the drive - it just seems to be .photolibrary bundles and .fcarch (Final Cut Archives).

Anyone know what's going on here, and how to fix it? My Mac sounds like a jet plane most of the time :(

I bought a Mac in November, I came from windows.. I used total commander for FTP before, so I bought the ForkLift 3 from binarynights to replace tc on Mac. I used and liked it till yesterday without any problem..  


I have 10 saved, favorite FTP connection. All of them working but only one stopped working..  
Just loading, trying to connect then 425 error or simply ""Timed Out"" error message..   
The settings all the same as before.. Passive mode, simple FTP connection, same server, same name, same password and same coding..   
Tried in Finder the connection works.  
Tried in another FTP client and also works..  
Tried in Forklift 1 from appstore (same company) and also working!  


Deleted the whole app, reinstalled but again only this one connection does not work..   
Deleted again, also removed every footprint from the System (preferences, app support, caches etc) and reinstall but all the same again... Only this one FTP connection doesn't work in ForkLift 3.........  


I wrote emails to them, I wrote on twitter to them but they didn't reply yet...

\- Mac firewall off (never was on) and nothing changed on my system settings..

1442,I’m thinking about buying an Apple laptop as a gift for a relative. I have never owned a Mac and really need some help from you guys in choosing which model to buy.,"I’m looking to buy a MacBook for my sister who is in her 1st year of university. She really needs a new laptop because her current Windows laptop is very old and barely functioning. As I stated in the title, I know close to nothing about Macs and Apple laptops but I like Apple products in general and I find them much more reliable than Windows laptops or Android phones. They just work and usually last a bit longer. 

I would really appreciate it if you guys can recommend me a MacBook model that is worth the price tag and would last and work well for at least the next 4 or 5 years. 

I’m definitely not looking for the latest and greatest just something that would be sufficient for everyday tasks such as writing college papers, taking notes, making presentations, social media, entertainment (music and movie streaming) and occasional gaming (stuff like League of Legends, The Sims etc). 

I really don’t know where to start. I’m not exactly on a budget but I’m looking for something in the reasonable price range. Is this even realistic? I honestly think it would be just a waste of money to go for a top end model when my sister wouldn’t even take advantage of the powerful specs and so on. Do you think I should look for a refurbished one? I’m not even sure if I can get one outside the US.

1457,Help! Can’t get to Mac OS Recovery,"My MacBook Air circa 2015 with current version of Catalina is stuck on the progress bar. 

It had this issue a just over week ago whilst running Mojave and after hooking it up to HDMI on the TV via a Thunderbolt adaptor for the first time in its life. It self corrected after 24 - 48 hours only to lose all sound soon after. The sound issue didn’t appear to be software related, the internal speakers were selected as output and coreaudiod was running so I assumed it was hardware. However, that issue self corrected also couple of days ago. 

I decided to update to Catalina thinking it might work some kinks out. 

Everything was fine. Have been using the HDMI set up without issue, but this morning I logged in only to find it getting stuck on the progress bar again. 

Summary: 

- Progress bar was stuck around 75% after login. 
- Tried to boot it into safe mode more than once, same issue and couldn’t get to safe mode. 
- I reset the PRAM and tried to boot it into recovery mode. 
- Progress bar now stuck at around 15% on the white apple logo and won’t boot into recovery mode. 
- Tried a standard reboot again, can get to the login screen, but progress bar stops at the same point as it did in recovery mode (15%). 
- Tried to get into recovery mode again, same problem
- Attempted internet recovery mode. Got the spinning globe and a prompt to enter my WiFi password. After loading on the globe it reverted to the Apple logo and looks like it’s attempting to access standard recovery mode with the same result - stuck on the progress bar.

1465,Warning! Always take pictures/video of items you’re taking in for repair.,"Update: got even worse.

I got a notification today that my MacBook was finally ready to pick up (for the second time) and having a bunch of assignments and quizzes due this weekend decided to drive straight there from work (60 mile round trip). I got to the store only to be given the exact same laptop in the exact same condition. That’s 120 miles driven total, over a week wasted and no further progress. This time I spoke to a different manager and explained how annoyed I am and how unacceptable this is. He kept saying how it was not the store/apples fault this happened as it was the repair center that damaged it. I couldn’t believe it! Like I brought it to Apple, under their warranty, and they agreed to fix it but I should separate their liability from the repair place?
He then went on to say how they’re already being generous by fixing it without fee as a gesture for my trouble. That’s when I had to interrupt and remind him that there is no fee as it’s covered under the extended warranty program, to fix a faulty by design keyboard. He said it’s not fault, so I asked why they issued the extended warranty for that problem and redesigned the keyboard twice since? And he insisted that he was supposed to charge me for it, and that I’m lucky they are even offering to fix the scratches (that were in his words “not even that bad and not a big deal”. On my $1500 laptop, that I paid for.) he kept talking over me and telling me that if im expecting to get a new laptop that it’s not going to happen. I almost popped a vein! 
I said I don’t want a new laptop I want MY laptop in the condition I left it in! My only option was to take it as is, or wait for it to be sent a 3rd time. I’m so pissed off and have never been treated like that in my life!
I’m not an asshole Karen customer, and don’t go into stores thinking I can treat people however I want. But to act like you’re doing me a favor by fixing damage caused by your store? Fuck that.
My friend was waiting to buy the laptop from me so I could upgrade to the 16”. Not a chance now! He can’t wait any longer and I’m not gonna bother giving them my money if that’s how they treat people. 



Dropped off my MacBook Pro to have the keyboard replaced under the extended warranty the other day. It was pristine and like new due to being cases and taken care of since I bought it. Went to pick it up today and after taking off the wrapping thing noticed 3-4 deep scratches all over the lid. I made sure to open it up in front of the employee that handed it to me. [pics](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OM0wRUd)

I immediately said “this was NOT like this when I dropped it off! I asked for a manager. I had 10 mins to get my laptop and go as I had work. The manager came over and immediately couldn’t be bothered with me. I told her that when I brought it in the condition was like new. She checked her iPad and said “unfortunately the genius you spoke with didn’t take pictures so there’s no way for me to know whether it came in like this”
At this point I was pissed. They had me drive 30 miles to the store, go 4 days without my only computer (during the start of school no less) to have the keyboard repaired which is fundamentally faulty by design and then had the audacity to scratch it all up and try and blame me for it? 
Luckily I was prepared for this, and showed her the 20+ pics I took of it, at the Genius Bar, On the same day and time it was checked in for repair (I always do this for any returns or warranty issues, and glad I do after this). She then turned  after reluctantly looking and said “sorry there’s no way for me to verify those”. 

I was close to losing it as I was late for work by that point, I told her to go get the genius who served me as he actually commented on how good the condition was given it’s 3yr age and at that point she said that she could wave the repair fee for the scratches as a gesture. Like it was a favor to fix the damage they caused. Anyway. I’m without my laptop for another 5 days, at a time when I need it more than ever. She didn’t even apologize, her attitude was just awful.
My first really bad Apple cs experience and it’s really turned me off them. They damaged my property, tried to blame me for it and didn’t even apologize.

1469,Printing from a Mac to a Windows 10 machine and printer over a network,"I have been trying to print from my Mac to my wife's Windows machine on and off for about 6 months and with no luck. Hard to believe in 2020 that this would still be an issue that these guys couldn't work out but so it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I tried this from my Mini running last years SW Mojave and her Windows 7 machine. I could never authenticate the printer because she didn't have a log in for her machine and the software on the Mac requires it. Fast Forward a few months and she has a W10 machine that requires a log in so lets try again.

&amp;#x200B;

The Players. 

&amp;#x200B;

HP All - in - One running W10 with all the latest and greatest updates with a Brother laser jet HL- L2300D hardwired to the machine ( printer is not wireless) - Her machine prints with no issues. I opened up the printer properties and turned on shared printing.

&amp;#x200B;

Mac Mini - running Catalina with all its updates  - I am hardwired to the router.

&amp;#x200B;

When I setup the printer on the Mac, it runs through all the setups, asks me the username and password for the W10 machine, accepts it ect and when I hit print it will bring up the print box and it shows the printer  and the preview but when I print it stops and I get a ""Hold for authentication error and done. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has gotten further than before as the Mac sees the printer and actually attempts to print but still nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

1471,Macbook Pro mid 2009 boot gets stuck on grey bar,"The  booting process gets stuck at 1/4, 1/2, or 3/4 the way to finishing  booting on the grey bar then just decides to shut itself off

side notes;

Macbook pro mid 2009 A1286 Macosx 10.11.6 ,

I tried using filevault encryption on 10.6.8 I vaguely remember force shutting down hafway through the encryption process.

then the booting process started to get stuck in the middle of booting through the grey bar

not sure if this is due to an update i used

battery needs to be replaced too many charged cycles

Using a Samsung SSD 250gb makes a barely audible buzzing groove sound I think this the normal sound it makes

I checked the Ram both are seated properly.

The only way to boot up properly through the grey bar and apple logo is to hold and move shake the laptop in a very subtle way -

Could  this have to do with any of the gold leads on the motherboard for any  one of the cable connectors connecting the SSD / Battery / Fan / etc?

\*I saw a slight indentation in a flat black cable beneath the ram.

Please  advise if anyone else encountered these bootup problems with replacing  the HD   or  Battery  or RAM did anything for boot.

1475,Mac is acting weird after deleting logic folder,"I was running out of space on my mac, its a macbook pro 2016 running sierra, so I deleted the /Library/Application Support/Logic folder.

Now, for some reason, I can't open a bunch of files in preview, and even though I used to be able to open docx files in pages, they don't open anymore. Also, when I open preview directly, a bunch of the file icons are just not there. The other thing is, however, whenever I open files, they're immediately duplicated, and make a new file with the same name, but a different timestamp.

Is there a way to fix this?

1476,"[Discussion] Getting the dreaded ""OS X could not be installed on your computer"" message while trying to reinstall Mac OS X El Capitan on an iMac (24"", early 2008)","At my workplace, where we're in the process of looking through our stash of older iMacs that we're looking to send off to a partner for Apple's business trade-in program.  I've now come across an older iMac, specifically a 24"" one from early 2008 that I needed to factory reset to prep it for this trade-in process.  

Unfortunately, I've hit a bit of a fork in the road, as while I tried to reinstall El Capitan, I'm getting the following message:

""OS X could not be installed on your computer.  No packages were eligible for install.  Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.  Quit the installer to restart your computer and try again.""

I've tried the following things in an attempt to get it past this error:

* Simply restarting
* Changing the date/time via terminal
* Starting the install from the beginning again

Like one month and a half or so it started doing weird things, sometimes when I was using while charging, it would get very slow and freeze. This was not always the case tho, with time it got to the point that I could only use it without it being connected also the HDD was almost full so I bought more space storage through iCloud. Anyways one day I was using it and all of a sudden it just froze and it wasn’t charging so i got worried and connected the charger since the battery was at like 10% left it there for about 1 hour and came back to check on it and it was still stuck so I disconnected the charger tried closing it and opening it but it was still stuck. What I did was hold the power button to restart the machine and it turned off but didn’t turn on when I tried to turning it on. I closed it and connected it to the charger and left it there and went to sleep the next day I tried to turn it on again but nothing happened and it’s been like that since, that was like in mid October. Whenever I connect it to the charger the charger’s light turns on but the Mac still won’t turn on. Has this happened to anyone here? And if so what did you do?

1479,BootCamp,"Hello. I am trying to convince my dad that BootCamp is safe so he can allow me to install it. He is a really big Apple fan if I may say so. Everything we have in the house is made by Apple. However, I use my computer mainly for gaming and it is a pain in the ass since most of the games I like do not support OS X. I managed to convince him to install Parallel Desktop but it doesn’t support the latest games. Lately I have been really into one particular game, but it doesn’t support mac nor third party programs and it’s multiplayer so I cannot hope for somebody to upload a torrent in the near future. I asked him if he can check out BootCamp but he said that it basically installs Windows on your hard disk and you have to restart your computer to switch between both which messes up your computer. Any advice on convincing him or perhaps finding alternative method to run the game? I have sent emails to the developers but they said they weren’t planning on making a mac version because it required too much time and effort which will slow down the development of more important features.",1,3,DKraeff,1,bootcamp,hello trying convince dad bootcamp safe allow install really big apple fan may say everything house made apple however use computer mainly gaming pain ass since games like support os x managed convince install parallel desktop support latest games lately really one particular game support mac third party programs multiplayer cannot hope somebody upload torrent near future asked check bootcamp said basically installs windows hard disk restart computer switch messes computer advice convincing perhaps finding alternative method run game sent emails developers said planning making mac version required much time effort slow development important features,bootcamp ,bootcamp ,bootcamp ,bootcamp ,bootcamp ,bootcamp 
1480,MacBook - display port-&gt;VGA-&gt;HDMI-&gt;CAT5 connection to projector problems,"Hoping someone might be able to suggest a solution to this.

At work we've just bought some HDMI-&gt;CAT5/6-&gt;HDMI senders/receivers to send video signals from some laptops over long distances to one of our projectors. Connecting a bog-standard Windows laptop via VGA connector works:

Laptop-&gt;VGA cable-&gt;VGA-to-HDMI-convertor-&gt;HDMI-to-CAT5-Sender etc.

Tried to do the same with a mid 2012 MacBook (High Sierra) using a Display Port-&gt;VGA adapter. When you make the connection you can see that the MacBook has recognised that a new display has been connected (you get the Displays icon in the status bar) but all we get is a blank, black output from the projector. If instead I bypass the HDMI-to-VGA converter and just use a Display Port-&gt;HDMI connector, it works fine. Also, connecting the MacBook directly to the projector via VGA/HMDI (MacBook-&gt;Display-Port-to-VGA-adapter-&gt;VGA cable-&gt;VGA-to-HDMI-converter-&gt;HMDI-&gt;projector) works perfectly fine.

For Macs the account name has to match the username in the JumpCloud system (first initial last name).

1506,Macbook Air 2017 Battery,"Hey guys!In November 2019 I bought a new Macbook Air 2017 and I've fallen in love with this device. It's fast, it made me more productive, it looks fantastic and it got me into the whole Apple ecosystem - this is my very first laptop. This is an awesome piece of hardware and I really want to use it for a long time. I mainly use this laptop for school, this is my last year as a language technology student hooray! I usually write assignments, and take notes on my laptop. Currently it's exam period so I just sit at home and study from this laptop. A while ago I noticed that the battery started deteriorating and I started panicking because this struck me as a surprise. I also freaked out because the full charge capacity started fluctuating between 95% and 100%. I think this deterioration is too fast or I might have been doing something wrong. So I decided to ask your opinion.  


[Link to my battery's current state](https://imgur.com/tssyQTW)

When I take notes in class, I only use the laptop from battery and discharge it until it hits 20% and then recharge it for the next day. When I'm at home I usually keep my laptop plugged in. I usually study 10 hours a day so it is heavily used. I've heard that many times that keeping a MacBook plugged in should not affect battery life, but apparently it's not true at least for me. I also exercised the battery but it continued to deteriorate. I also used an app called amphetamine to keep the screen awake so I didn't have to move the cursor around every now and then. I also kept wifi and bluetooth on the whole time, and was listening to music from Spotify. 

What's your opinion? Was I destroying my battery by keeping it plugged in the whole time? Was the app causing the problem? Is it just a Catalina bug? How can I preserve battery life most efficiently?

I tried an SMC and PRAM reset but without success.

What I also noticed yesterday, is that when plugged in, I can hear a very quit regular noise coming from it that is similar to a clock ticking ( I can not exactly determine the origin of the noise, the Air is very tiny) the same noise is becoming faster (the pace of ticking becomes higher) when I press the power button, but it’s still impossible to start it.

2) crack open the late 2013 iMac and swap out the fusion

I’ve had Apple keep it for a couple of days to do diagnostics and they say there’s no hardware problem. They asked me to re-install MacOS.  I’ve done that, without restoring a backup. It still powers  off. 

I took the MacBook to Apple immediately after a power off so they can have a more precise look at the logs upon the next boot up. While they were looking at it, it started powering off on them. The Genius Bar dude blamed it on Microsoft One Drive after seeing some failure to connect messages in the logs and turning off Microsoft apps and running their 3D graphics for 20 minutes. Of course , I take the MacBook home and I am only using Safari and have not opened a Microsoft app, and it powers off again. 

These are immediate power offs with no crash dump messages or asks to report to Apple.  

I am running Mojave. I can’t go to Catalina yet because my employer doesn’t support Catalina. 

Any suggestions?

That being said, I will occasionally need it for heavier work when I'm away from home, namely:

* Recording with an audio interface into Ableton, sometimes mixing (worried about latency and crackling)
* Editing RAW photos in Lightroom/Photoshop

What I'm concerned about is excess latency or lag due to the older processor in the Air, especially after a few years. I won't push it often, but it needs to be stable when I do, and I don't want to be looking for a replacement a few years down the road.

1589,Macbook Pro having issues,"So yesterday I accidentally dropped my laptop while it was in a backpack because the hook in a bathroom stall broke. I have a 15"" Macbook Pro Retina from late 2015 and has had one battery replacement (3rd party because I had a lot of issues at Apple where they wouldn't replace it for me). Other than the previous battery issue the laptop ran fine until the drop; now my mac starts but it can't detect the trackpad or the keyboard, and the fan is going 5 million miles an hour. Other than that the battery still works fine and doesn't seem to be overheating at all. I plugged in an external mouse and keyboard and both work, which tells me that the USB ports are working... the only other thing is that there is a HUGE slowdown on the entire processing ability of the laptop. It takes forever to type one letter and the dock animation is slow and glitchy. Applications open fine, but again is very slow. The screen still works perfectly. 

I guess my question is, is this whole situation fixable? I'm not going to go the Apple route because I already have a non-apple battery and they said I had ""water damage"" on the laptop so I apparently already threw away whatever warranty they could do on it. I would really prefer to fix this one (eg. at UBreakIFix) instead of straight up replacing because I have a lot of things on this one and it carried me all throughout college. Please let me know if I royally fucked up this time by trying to hang up my backpack (😭), and thanks in advance!

1603,SSD and RAM Upgrade Macbook Pro (Mid-2012)," 

Hi Guys!

I have a Macbook Pro that I want to upgrade the memory and and hard drive on. This model of Macbook had known hard drive issues and it is very obvious when using it especially while multitasking apps.

Does anyone know if the upgrades are possible on this model, and could suggest where I can find parts to suit (Australia). Any suggestions would be very helpful.

On a side note, how would I move OSX across to a brand new hard drive? Would the hardware allow me to download it from the internet upon booting?

1606,Why is browsing for a file from a file selection dialog in any given Mac OS app so slow if a folder just contains 1500 items?,"I don't care what anyone says, 1500 isn't that many items. Here's why I have folders with 1500 items: When there's so much stuff in my desktop that it starts to slow my computer down, I chuck it all into a folder called ""stuff 1/13/20"" (or whatever the date is that day). Usually these folders will contain 1000+ items. Sometimes I revisit one of the stuff folders in search of a specific file. Well, browsing to a folder with 1500 items and typing just 4 letters to jump to the correct file name forces me to sit through a full minute of beachball spinning as it painstakingly tries to find the correct file one letter at a time. Why? It's the easiest thing in the world to code a file selection dialog that loads the entire list of file names from a folder into RAM and then jumps to the correct file instantly based on the keystroke input. Yet for some reason, it takes 15 seconds of beachball spinning between each letter typed. How does Apple get this wrong? System 7 would have had no trouble whatsoever doing this in a folder with 1500 items at lightning speed with 0.1% of the same amount of RAM. What is wrong with the people who code for Apple nowadays? Is there some setting I can change to prevent this insane lag? And to the sassy cats itching to respond, there's no rule against having 1500 items in a folder, and it's completely reasonable to expect that any basic functionality will work fine with 1500 items in a folder.

Worst thing is that I didn’t realise at first. It must’ve been 15-20 minutes until I realised because I was cleaning the mess and then eating dinner. I have left it upright but on it’s side like how a picture frame would hang during this time.

Then when I tried to use it afterwards (still unaware) I opened the lid but nothing happened (since I had put it to sleep, not shut down). I even pressed the power button and still nothing happened. After this I removed the plastic cases and cleaned all the water away which took only about 10 seconds, there wasn’t a lot. 

Then I messed up again a short while after looking online for tips because I pressed the freaking power button, it turned on with the white Apple logo. I saw the password entry screen and the screen went black.  It’s been about an hour since then and i haven’t touched it since but have left it in the tent pose. 

How screwed am I?

1676,SSD ( NVME Flash) for iMac Pro - Is it possible to use externally?,"My question is as following; Is it possible to reformat/use the new SSD (( NVME Flash )) externally via an adaptor -

I’ve wiped the HD and it's been pulled out. But I’d like to install the mac OS independently from the Imac since the machine is out of action currently . With any other computer, it’s not even a question to pull out a hard drive and use it as an external. Is that possible with the t2 chipped computers, and with this new type of storage in the Imac pro??

Are these **NVM-e PCI-e SSD drives** truly proprietary to apple? Or can use them with a universal adaptor like the one available on [ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/Universal-Drive-Adapter/IF107-108?o=1) ?

Lots of conflicting information out there-

&gt;I’ve read as followingThe storage in the iMac Pro uses two banks of flash chips, effectively in a RAID 0 configuration. All data written to/from the SSD goes through the T2 security processor, and all data on the flash is encrypted. You can not, for example, pull the SSD modules from one iMac and read them in another iMac - the T2 prevents this from working.

But I haven't given up home as a dedicated DYIer

1683,Looking for recommendations for central backup server,"I currently have three MacBook Pro's and one Windows 10 PC.

I use one Mac daily for work, one randomly when it's nearby, and my wife uses the third one.  The PC is used to run a couple IP cameras and for occasional gaming - nothing really important on it, but I'll follow-up on that part later.

So for the macs I've been just running time machine backups on external drives.  It's super annoying to plug in a drive, especially if a backup is going to take a while and I'm stuck having to carry the external drive with me.  It also means that my wife rarely backs up her computer.  I do run some manual backups to S3 occasionally, but that's just for select things where I want an extra offsite backup.

I did set up an external drive to my old router a few years ago and that worked okay for a while, but it wasn't a reliable solution and eventually stopped working.

So I'm considering a couple of options, but wanted to get some thoughts from others that may have more experience.

1. Get a Synology.  I'm looked into these before and it looks like they should work reasonably well for my needs.  A bonus is I may be able to even use it to offload the IP cams and my Plex media server so that my PC can be dedicated to gaming.
2. Expand my PC with additional hard drives and use some kind of software to enable my mac to backup to shared PC drives.  I think this may be the cheaper option and will let me take advantage of a PC that I rarely use.  That said, I'm not sure how reliable this is or what types of software would be best to accomplish this.

**My overall goals would be:**

* Central location for backups via time machine (no more external drives)
* Ability to backup wirelessly (one laptop is plugged into Cat6, but others on just wifi)
* Bonus: a place for my media (movies and music) for access via Plex
* Bonus: a place to run my IP cameras

Was hoping someone here may have some experience with both of these methods and may be able to give some recommendations.

1716,"MacBook Pro 13"" (2019, 2.4Ghz, 256gb ssd, 4 TB3 ports version) + iPad Pro 11"" 512GB, Cellular + Wifi) VS MacBook Pro 16""","I currently have MacBook Pro 16"" and iPhone 11 Pro Max 256GB. I am considering selling them and getting MacBook Pro 13"" + iPad Pro 11"" and iPhone 11 Pro. Most of my work is related to documents editing, usual business stuff and light photo/video editing. It a though decision, advice is more than welcome!

For the past 10+ years I have always used devices with biggest screen (eg. 15"" MBP, 12.9"" IPP, and iPhone Max/Plus) by default. Never really thought about why until recently when I tried the smaller version of the new iPhone (11 pro) and I really liked the fact that I could use it with one hand and generally the portability of it. Now that I am back to using my bigger 11 pro max, the size of it is starting to bother me. Furthermore, after Apple has increased the size of the new MBP 16"" it really is cumbersome to carry around everyday. So relating to my experience with the smaller iPhone I am starting to think (since the capabilities of smaller devices have been significantly improved with the intel 8th gen processors and onwards) that I would also be better off with a smaller MBP 13"" as my everyday carry instead of the MBP 16"". I will be buying the new UltraFine 5K LG Monitor soon, regardless of which device I settle with and. I think that MBP 13"" would work with it perfectly, when I need a larger screen, while on the other hand it would be easier for me to carry it around when I need to . Now, since I am not a digital artist and I find digital note taking to be much more efficient with typing than writing I am really struggling to find the purpose of the iPad Pro 11"". One thought I have is to use it as a secondary monitor when on the go and also as a media consumption device (but MBP 13"" Is probably better in that regard).",5,5,Baronmist,1,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 ports version ipad pro 11 512gb cellular wifi vs macbook pro 16,currently macbook pro 16 iphone 11 pro max 256gb considering selling getting macbook pro 13 ipad pro 11 iphone 11 pro work related documents editing usual business stuff light photo video editing though decision advice welcome past 10 years always used devices biggest screen eg 15 mbp 12 9 ipp iphone max plus default never really thought recently tried smaller version new iphone 11 pro really liked fact could use one hand generally portability back using bigger 11 pro max size starting bother furthermore apple increased size new mbp 16 really cumbersome carry around everyday relating experience smaller iphone starting think since capabilities smaller devices significantly improved intel 8th gen processors onwards would also better smaller mbp 13 everyday carry instead mbp 16 buying new ultrafine 5k lg monitor soon regardless device settle think mbp 13 would work perfectly need larger screen hand would easier carry around need since digital artist find digital note taking much efficient typing writing really struggling find purpose ipad pro 11 one thought use secondary monitor go also media consumption device mbp 13 probably better regard,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port version ipad pro 11 512gb cellular wifi v macbook pro 16 ,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port vert ipad pro 11 512gb cellul wif vs macbook pro 16 ,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port version ipad pro 11 512gb cellular wifi vs macbook pro 16 ,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port version ipad pro 11 512gb cellular wifi v macbook pro 16 ,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port vert ipad pro 11 512gb cellul wif vs macbook pro 16 ,macbook pro 13 2019 2 4ghz 256gb ssd 4 tb3 port version ipad pro 11 512gb cellular wifi vs macbook pro 16

1731,So I’m looking at taking a job in a Mac environment. Looking for tips to avoid looking incompetent,"Like the title says I’m considering a job change and the new company threw me a curveball with “we use Macs.”

Out of everything this worries me the most.  I did some animations for a class in undergrad like 20 years ago and was so frustrated with having to use Macs and later being a competitive FPS player I never had any reason to use them.

I imagine a lot has changed and they are more friendly to the uninitiated PC user now.  

Is there anywhere that can help me not look like an idiot in the transition?

I have really stupid questions like will my Rad red mechanical keyboard, wireless headset, or mouse all that use regular old PC ports and dongles work?

Another big component is Keynote.  Apparently everything gets done in that.  I have a ton of PowerPoint stuff stockpiled to make me look like I have design sense.  Do the two programs understand each other?

1732,2016 12” MacBook Last Boot,"Need some help with my Macbook. It was automatically turning off, and I tried updating it to see if that helped. Never quite got it going again. It would turn off after loading and it wasn't always responsive to the power button. The last time I was able to turn it on I got this screen. Resetting SMC didn't work. Removing the power to the logic board didn't work. The track pad is responsive if I hit the power button while it is plugged in, but it will not power the trackpad if I try to start the computer without the power plugged in.

1735,Macbook pro 16 2019: Gets way too hot when running a light load of tasks,"Hi,

I switched from Windows to the MacBook Pro 16. So far the experience has been great except when I'm coding.

I have noticed that my laptop would get unreasonably warm when Pycharm is running.

My usual tasks that are running in a normal session are:

* Pycharm
* Safari (3 to 6 tabs, one of them runs youtube)
* Terminal
* Spotify

I am not doing anything intensive. I hover around 5% CPU usage and 5 to 7Gbs of Ram usage (out of 16Gbs).

The keyboard and the area above the Touch Bar gets incredibly warm.

I do apologize for not posting any sort of metrics regarding temperatures but I do not believe it should get this warm under such a light load.

I contacted Apple about this and they ran diagnostics and said everything was fine. We did a power cycle and if the problem still persisted, I should call apple back.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it somewhat disturbing that my MacBook Pro would get this hot under such a light load compared to my 2014 Lenovo y410p laptop.

Is this a normal behavior of a MacBook Pro (asking as someone who never owned a mac)?

Thanks!

I've just recently bought an imac and i'm having issues with external harddrives.

Even until yesterday, I was able to use the Seagate Backup Plus  hard drive on the i mac, although I wasn't able to write in it. I installed NTFS but I think I ejected the harddrive improperly once and ever since then it never was able to mount. It does show up on Disk Utilities, but not in the finder. 

The thing is, the same harddrive works on my macbook pro, just not my imac. 

Also, I had a sd card improperly ejected from the imac, and ever since then it just wouldn't mount to the imac again (with the mbp it did still). I've tried searching the web for ways to figure this out but unfortunately couldn't do so. It'd be great if someone could sort me out here, cuz I don't want to buy a new harddrive when I have a perfectly functioning one right in front of me. I'm pretty sure it's a software issue, but i'm not sure what it is or how I can fix it.

1772,Bluetooth and Wifi dropouts on iMac 2019,"Hey guys,

i have a 2019 27"" iMac with Catalina 10.15.2.

For some time now I have been experiencing Wifi and Bluetooth dropouts. The Magic Mouse, keyboard and trackpad are shown as connected, but they stutter from time to time or have complete dropouts for 1-2 seconds. Same problem with Wifi.

After calling Apple support I should bring the Mac to a service provider. There the logicboard was exchanged. The iMac was not further examined for errors, since these occur only sporadically and sometimes it runs for several hours without problems.

I picked up the iMac again, but the same problems with the mouse and the trackpad still existed, but the Wifi worked without dropouts.

I then called Apple support again and was told to try:   
\- reset the iMac to factory defaults and not install a backup,  
\- reset the Apple Watch to factory defaults and do not install a backup and, if necessary, switch it off if the error occurs (to rule out a connection failure)  
\- and then do an SMC reset on the iMac.

After I did all that, the iMac worked without problems for 3 days.   
Now the mouse has dropouts again and does not react every now and then.   
However, the iMac still does not indicate that the connection is lost.   
The Wifi is also experiencing dropouts again. It shows an active connection, but does neither open websites anymore nor access the FritzBox or other devices locally.

The workaround is either to restart the iMac or turn Wifi off and on again.  
If the Magic Mouse is experiencing dropouts, turning it off and on will also help.  
This will work for a few minutes until the errors reappear.

MacBook, iPhone and iPad have no problem. There the Wifi and Bluetooth connection to the mouse work just as well.

I’m mainly going to be using it for standard stuff, no graphics or editing etc BUT I had my last MacBook for 7 years so I need it to LAST.

1816,Luna Display question,"Greetings, folks.

I’m trying to figure out if Luna Display is the right solution for me. Here is my situation:

Have a Mac mini at my desk (2012, so Side Car is not an option.) I often work from other places around our office (on my 11” iPad Pro.) I generally prefer iOS, but there are a few things I need macOS for. I’d like to be able to fully access my Mac from my iPad while I’m here at the office (on the same WiFi, and remote access is not needed.)

I tried Duet Air and was not very pleased with the performance or options.

What I would really like is for my iPad display to fill up with macOS (rather than the aspect ratio of my monitor being maintained) and for my Smart Keyboard to work as expected. It seems Luna would accomplish this.

However, what I’m not sure about is connecting and disconnecting remotely. As long as Luna is running on my desktop, can I just fire up the app on the iPad and it’ll run as expected? Or will I have the monitor aspect ratio as long as the monitor is connected to my Mac mini? (Does that question make sense?)

Any input from Luna users—does Luna sound like the right solution?

I’ve looked into Remote Desktop solutions a bit, and they all seem to lack in smoothness, quality, aspect ratio, usability, etc.

1820,~$500 to repair 2017 MacBook Pro. Fix or toss??,"I have a 2017 MacBook Pro that I purchased 2 and a half years ago. Apple quoted me $475 or somewhere around that to replace the logic board.

I am the proud owner of a 2018 Macbook. I love everything about it, and it meets my needs 99% of the time. Typically, I do not need to connect any cords or anything to my laptop so the 1 USB-C port serves me just fine.

However, I now find myself needing to connect to not one, but TWO separate monitors. Both of these monitors ONLY have VGA connection ports. I currently have a multiport dongle which has one VGA port on it.

I am desperately searching for some sort of dongle or adapter that will allow me to connect both of these VGA only monitors to my Macbook, and USE both of the monitors as separate displays, rather than mirroring the display to both.

This was done through the Login Items section of the Users &amp; Groups system settings.

The problem is, I'm often working remotely, and when I do so, I have to connect to the office via VPN. In these cases, when I'm not connected to the network at the time I login, I get something like 20 consecutive error messages telling me it can't connect to the network drive.

This was also so easy in Windows. When I'm on the network, my drives get mapped. When I'm not, they don't. I don't get a whole bunch of pop-ups to click through when I'm not on the network.

So instead of putting more money than it was worth into fixing it I thought I'd have some fun. I disassembled the whole thing until I could get each component as separate as possible to put into a case of sorts. This is when I ran into my first issue. I took the little door that housed the bonus display port, usb, and audio Jack and headed to staples to get a mini display port (this is what APPLES website said it was I shit you not) converter so I would no longer need a built in screen. However this didn't fit, so I returned it and and basically tested every cord out with the dude there. No luck. Me and him google for half an hour to try and figure this out until we come to the conclusion of ""micro DVI""  so I order an OEM one from an apple reseller. The adapter is at least 10 years old at this point. It comes in the mail and if you bend it at all and the outer shell crumbles. Great. I decide that instead of returning something that just shouldn't of existed I would just try it and see if it could just work.

1865,Security recommendations / considerations to maximise longevity for an aging mbp running mavericks?,"Hi! 

I've a 2013 15"" mbp running 10.9.5 Mavericks. Top spec when it was released. Its a lovely machine and is my main computer for work and personal use. It has a lot of software on it that does everything i need it to, MS office that is working bought outright not subscription which is great for me. As is Adobe CS6 and lots of other bits that are perfect. As well as music making plugins and now discontinued software for older versions of Logic 9. 

I realise the newer OS is faster, looks nicer and is a lot slicker in many ways. I’m just not interested in upgrading just for aesthetic reasons. 

I have a theory about how a computer is never as fast as the OS that it ships with. This isn’t planned obsolescence, more the OS’ aren’t as optimised for older hardware as they are for newer stuff and naturally things work less well. 

My question is what can I do to maximise the security and longevity for this ageing machine? I realise apple stopped releasing security updates for 10.9.5 years ago. Many features like the icloud functions also stopped long ago, never really used them anyway. 

From a security point of view, are there any practical dangers of running an older system like this daily? Are older machines really more susceptible to being hacked etc? 

I’m considering removing email entirely from the mac as a way to reduce risk of a phishing like scam. 

What other issues are important / worth thinking about? I have considered running an external ssd with a new OS for select software that i cant run on this but would still love to keep the mavericks dream alive.

If you have a similar setup, what helps with this? 

I use firefox (latest version) and a VPN. From an OS level, is there anything I can do to lock this machine down to be more secure or just keep it going for another few years. I’d love to get 10/15 years of use from this old girl.

The Problem:   
Now I've noticed an odd problem when any of my displays is viewing something in full screen: The other displays all turn black. Also, I can no longer independently shift my displays between their own virtual desktops. (three-finger swipe left or right to display other full-screen browsers or programs). When I try, all the displays move together. This is completely unusable for my workflow. (I use RDP to display a windows system on several of my monitors and my Mac desktop on the others).    


My troubleshooting steps:   


* I tried unplugging the new monitor to see if the behavior reverts to allowing me independent control over each monitor's virtual desktop: No go.  

* I tried power cycling the mac (thought it might be an improperly loaded driver or something). No go.

Not every one, of course, but the prices I'm seeing for the logic board alone makes me wonder if it isn't worth parting the MacBook out. But on the other hand, who in their right mind, and with the skills to replace components in a MacBook, would pay more for just a logic board when they could pay less for an entire MacBook and pull the board themselves?

I'm sure I'm missing something simple but I wanted to check with the experts before I list it. Thanks for any help you can provide.

I have three Macs backing up to it, but one Mac is hogging all the space. I have a Mac mini and two MacBook Pros. The Mac mini has solid Time Machine backups all the way back to June 2019. One MBP has one backup from November, and the other is backed-up to yesterday.

The Mac mini gets the most use and is connected via Ethernet, so it makes sense that it would back up more frequently. But I definitely don't need six plus months of backup on one machine while the others are complaining about running out of space. 

I'm thinking I might need to backup the Mac mini to a different drive, delete its Time Machine backup completely, and start over fresh. But I'm concerned I'll run into the same situation a few months from now.

Is there a way to tell these three Macs to share the Time Machine space nicely?

1931,PC guy trying to revive a friend's 2010 iMac. I get the chime and then a blank screen. More details in the comments.,"iMac A1311, EMC 2389. 

On pressing the power button I get a chime but no display. I can hear a noise that I believe is the fan. If it's the HD it's noisy for an HDD.

What's been done so far:

- He took it to a Genius bar and they connected a second display, which also was blank.
- The Apple guy said ""it could be...."" and listed most of the main components. It was left at that because he doesn't have the $$ to pay for a repair.
- I tried a different power cord.
- I only have a PC USB keyboard and tried resetting the PRAM with Win+ALT+P+R and had no response.
- It's not a backlight issue, I looked carefully and there's nothing on the display.

If it were the HDD a PC would display something, BIOS and an error message. Same for an iMac?

Assuming so then I'm guessing power supply most likely, then logic board.

1943,"13"" or 16"" Macbook Pro for iOS &amp; Web Dev?","I'm looking to upgrade my aging dual core 2015 13"" base MBP. I'm torn between a 13"" 2019 model (maxed CPU, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD) for $2199 vs a 16"" base model for $2499 (512 GB, 16 GB RAM, base processor and GPU).

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly do web dev and iOS development, where the latter tends to be bottlenecked more when testing apps in the simulator. I also do some video work on the side, not 4K but I think the dGPU would still help with my workflow and if I end up doing 4K someday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Portability is important and I hear that the 16"" is quite heavy and seeing in a store it's much larger than the 13"" I have. The 13"" on the other hand is more portable but has a worse keyboard and no dGPU, so in a way is less future proofed.

1965,Help upgrading/buying new mac/hackintosh,"Hi all,

currently I have almost 6 years old Mac Pro 2013, trash can. 6-core CPU, 32GB RAM, 512GB SDD and dual D500 GPUs. 

I work as freelance iOS developer, but I also make app designs, assets, animations and so on. To sum it up, I do everything, from consulting, design to finished app. I also develop mobile games in my free time and make my own art and assets for games.

My toolset: 

&amp;#x200B;

* xcode
* adobe illustrator &amp; photoshop - currently slowly switching to affinity designer and photo. 
* adobe after effects - for animations, that are later exported as Lottie json files and used in apps
* sketch and sometimes Adobe XD for creating wireframes, icons, designs,…
* sometimes I also play a bit in Maya and make some of my own models.

And after a long day I like to play a game or two. Yes I use mac for gaming. I’m not pro gamer, but more like casual. For some games I even use Bootcamp, but I like it more if game works in macOS better. My favourite games are strategy and sandbox games, but I also like RPG games. 

Few examples: paradox line: crusader kings, europa universalis, imperator, hearts of iron, stellaris, and then American and euro truck simulator, factorio, men of war, space engineers, kerbal space program, world of warcraft, diablo 3, assasins creed,… Stuff like that. 

Ok now to part why I’m writing all this: 

My computer is working ok, I have no problems with it, except performance. Xcode can take up to 10 minutes to compile sometimes, opening stories is kinda slow, but even more slow zooming in and out and moving things around. What kind of slow? Well like 1-2 second lag sometimes and most annoying it is when I move one thing and then everything gets stuck and I release and then it drops in totally wrong position. Also some projects in illustrator can be very freakin slow, as well in photoshop. I’m looking at you wacom and photoshop combination where using brush or mix brush can be so slow I would just throw whole computer out. Affinity works better, but I’m not used to their tools yet, but there is still a bit of “lag”

In sketch I get also slow scrolling/zooming/placing when I reach certain amount of “screens” so I have to break down every project into smaller parts. :( 

In some games I get max 30-40FPS, in some even less. 

So I suspect that GPU isn’t good enough. Or maybe I use too big resolution monitors (I have 2 4K dell monitors). I like to have higher resolution when I write code and work with precision graphics. On macOS it seems that computer runs monitor on native 4K no matter what scaled resolution I set so this might be slowing down everything? But heck in some games having 4K is a good advantage (strategy games, factorio,…). 

Ok anyway, after 6 years of faithful service I’m thinking about buying new mac. At first I was waiting for new Mac Pro and I was thinking about buying 16-core version with 96GB RAM (xcode sometimes easts almost whole 32GB ram itself), 2TB and Radeon Pro Vega II duo. That machine would get me to around 17k€ which is a lot compared I have paid around 5k€ for my current mac pro and I got a lot of bang for that buck. 

I’m afraid of putting so much money in machine that is actually not even best piece of hardware that is on market. 6 years back, this mac was a pretty beast and using latest technology, now we have AMD cpus that are much faster and also using PCI-e 4.x and cost much less. I would be kinda ok with a pricetag around 9k€, but 17k is a bit much even for me. And also I saw some test somewhere on reddit where someone tested new 16-core mac pro and new 6-core mac mini and mini beat 16 core mac pro in compile test, and mac pro was using all 16 cores. I do not know what to make out of it but I really would not like to throw that kind of sum and then cry at home having so low performance. 

Maybe mac pro isn’t for me after all?

It crossed my mind to buy new mac mini maxed out and then buy additional external eGPU, but here I’m also afraid this might not work in all apps and games (and also bootcamp) and also TB3 can be a pretty bottleneck on GPU side. 

Then I thought about building a hackintosh, but again I would like to have care free and fully working mac system. And I really do not know what kind of components to buy to be best compatible and to be tested enough not to break down in next 5 years. 

I would spend around 9k€ on new computer, it needs to be working care free for next 5 years and also not overheat and give me more performance than my current one. I also need windows for some games even tho I hate windows so I use it ONLY for running some games and I would not like to use other programs there. If I go to hackintosh path, I would also like to have working iMessages and everything else (app store, updates, bluetooth, apple keyboard and trackpad,…). Yes I use trackpad and mouse. Trackpad is so nice in some apps that I can’t live without it and mouse is used for gaming and in some edge cases in apps where I cannot be so accurate with trackpad. 

Ok so here is my question: How can I get new computer where macOS works 100% and give me more bang for the buck than new mac pro systems? Or should I just swalow this sour apple and pay that high price for it? I like apple and I like their OS, ecosystem and reliability, but their computers can be sometimes very underperforming or too expensive. I also buy computer for 5+ years so I would not like to have it break down in middle of work or to replace components all the time. Buy once and work in peace for next 5+ years.
